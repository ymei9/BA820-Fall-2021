87.0,Food,"The new owner of San Francisco‚Äôs historic Anchor Brewing is undecided about whether it will follow through on plans to build a production facility and visitors center at Pier 48, a project city officials have long hoped would not only attract beer lovers but also bring blue-collar jobs back to the waterfront.‚ÄúThe short answer is they are currently considering any and all matters and have not made any decisions with respect to ongoing projects,‚Äù said Sapporo Holdings spokesman Gino Colangelo. ‚ÄúNothing has been decided outside of the initial acquisition.‚ÄùThe Japanese group Sapporo announced this week that it had purchased Anchor Brewing, the craft-beer pioneer established in 1896.In 2013, Anchor announced that it would expand from its Potrero Hill facility to Pier 48, which is adjacent to Seawall Lot 337, where the San Francisco Giants are in the final stages of planning a mega-development that will bring 1.4 million square feet of office space, 8 acres of parkland and 1,500 rental housing units to a surface parking lot across Mission Creek from AT&T Park. The project is known as Mission Rock.While the revival of Pier 48 is a relatively small part of the Giants‚Äô overall plan, it was a sentimental favorite of San Franciscans with an attachment to Anchor Brewing. The original plan called for a production facility that would increase capacity from 180,000 to 680,000 barrels.Everything from brewing to packaging to shipping, as well as a restaurant, museum and educational space, would be included. At a time when maritime jobs have largely vanished from the San Francisco waterfront, port officials were especially pleased that Anchor planned to ship beer from the pier.But even before the Sapporo announcement, Anchor‚Äôs commitment to the project had started to falter as projected costs to reinforce the pier for additional uses skyrocketed. In May, port officials revealed that the Pier 48 portion of the development, which had been expected to start in early 2019, would be be pushed back several years into a later phase of the Mission Rock development.Port Project Manager Phil Williamson said the Anchor project is still part of the overall Giants project that will be before the Planning Commission on Oct. 5.‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs a vision that a lot of people are excited about, we have made the decision to move any industrial development like Anchor Brewing to a future phase of the project,‚Äù Williamson said.Pier 48 currently generates income for the port from parking, storage for the Department of Elections and some special events. Williamson said current uses will likely remain there for at least ‚Äúfive to 10 years.‚Äù In September, TechCrunch will host its annual TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017 conference in the 80,000-square-foot pier shed.‚ÄúWe want to keep the facility in usable condition, generating port revenue,‚Äù Williamson said.While Pier 48 received some seismic improvements after a fire in 2002, converting it to a heavy public use with hundreds of daily visitors and workers would trigger a higher standard of reinforcement.Giants spokeswoman Staci Slaughter said it‚Äôs too early to say how the sale of Anchor Brewing will impact the Pier 48 project.‚ÄúThe Giants and Anchor have enjoyed a very successful partnership for a number of years, and we‚Äôre committed to maintaining our strong relationship with future ventures, including at Mission Rock,‚Äù she said.Whether Sapporo decides to move into Pier 48, the Giants are ‚Äúcommitted to rehabbing the pier and the apron around it,‚Äù Slaughter said. ‚ÄúThat pier is going to be a vibrant part of our project.‚ÄùMeanwhile, residents who want to see an active waterfront are also uncertain about the future. Jasper Rubin, a San Francisco State University professor of urban studies who sits on several waterfront-related committees, said he loved the Anchor Brewing vision for Pier 48, but his initial reaction to the news of its sale was broader.‚ÄúMy biggest concern is not with Pier 48 but with the Potrero brewery itself, and I am hoping that nothing happens to that faculty,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our biggest (production) facility‚Äù in the city.Corinne Woods, a member of the port‚Äôs Central Waterfront Advisory Group who lives in a houseboat on Mission Creek, said the escalating cost of fixing the city‚Äôs crumbling piers casts doubt on a the economic viability of several port rehabilitation projects.‚ÄúOver the last year we have learned a lot more about the condition of the piers, and the kind of money it takes to fix them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEverybody is still trying to figure out what can be done ‚Äî and what it will cost and whether there is enough of a return on investment to make it pay.‚Äù J.K.

57.0,Food,"It was a taste of date syrup that made Sylvie Charles give up a career in medicine.While a resident at UC San Francisco in 2015, Charles was on an extended medical leave after a spinal injury. It was the first time she really had time to think about what she wanted since she was 17, about to start college and hell-bent on becoming a doctor. During the time off, she realized her real passion was to provide nourishing food to people ‚Äî to prevent disease rather than treat it.‚ÄúWhat I had always been passionate about was integrative health and wellness,‚Äù says Charles, now 31. She wasn‚Äôt sure that continuing in her medical practice would resonate with the Eastern part of medicine that felt natural to her.The daughter of Indian immigrants, Charles had grown up with ayurvedic practices, which rely heavily on food as medicine. During medical school at the University of Southern California, where she worked at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the number of patients suffering from diet-related illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease ‚Äî health problems increasingly associated with high sugar consumption ‚Äî was overwhelming.‚ÄúIt really was one of the more impactful experiences of my life. At L.A. County you‚Äôre really exposed to some of the sickest people in all walks of life,‚Äù she says.Inspired by her mother and aunt‚Äôs cooking, Charles made her first foray into the food business with a line of bottled Indian sauces made without refined sugar. She was working on a recipe for traditional tamarind sauce when she decided to use dates instead of sugar as a sweetener. She already knew dates‚Äô nutritional components well: Compared to cane sugar and even maple syrup and honey, they have a low glycemic index and are high in minerals, antioxidants and fiber.So she simmered plump Medjool dates in water until tender, strained them and pureed them. She dipped a spoon into the pot. The dates had dissolved into a liquid caramel, not too sweet, with the depth of molasses but without its bitterness.Charles instantly knew date syrup was her destiny.‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòOh my gosh ‚Äî this is really delightful,‚Äô‚Äù recalls Charles with a warm, gentle laugh. ‚ÄúWhat a way to get both serious flavor and serious nutrition.‚ÄùCharles dropped out of her residency and last year launched the new company she calls Just Date Syrup. While her Indian sauces were a hard sell, the syrup found a market right away, including at Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco and the online grocer Good Eggs, and will be at Whole Foods in the fall.While her parents thought she was having a mental breakdown when she first left her medical practice ‚Äî her father and father-in-law are both doctors, and her mother-in-law is a nurse ‚Äî they have since come around. Her husband also stopped practicing medicine to work in a venture capital firm that invests in biotechnology.‚ÄúOur generation values doing something you love,‚Äù Charles says. ‚ÄúAnd there are more people leaving to find careers that are related to medicine, or not.‚ÄùIn her case, the connection is pretty clear. Alternative sweeteners have become a hot commodity as research continues to link sugar intake with obesity, diabetes, heart disease and liver disease. While sodas and other sweetened beverages are an obvious culprit, 74 percent of packaged foods, from whole wheat bread to pasta sauce, contain added sugar, according to a 2012 study in Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Charles says that using date syrup can help anyone avoid spikes in blood sugar caused by sweeteners with a higher glycemic index, which can negatively affect mental and physical performance. Dates are also popular among adherents of paleo and other diets that don‚Äôt allow traditional sweeteners. A ready-to-go syrup allows home cooks to avoid having to pit, soak and puree them, while still retaining some of the fiber.Charles was happy to discover that dates have been used in ayurvedic practice for thousands of years, to promote sleep and induce labor ‚Äî which is fortuitous since she‚Äôs expecting her first child.From a flavor perspective, dates complement coffee particularly well, and Charles has created recipes for date syrup granola, salad dressing, Chinese and Japanese sauces, and beverages that are typically loaded with sugar, such as her Strawberry Mint Agua Fresca.Date syrup can be used in a 1:1 ratio for liquid sweeteners in recipes, but it is more challenging to use in standard baking recipes. Charles uses it in a tahini chocolate chip cookie that she adapted from a popular recipe by Toronto pastry chef Danielle Oron. Her company is developing a fruit-derived granulated sweetener for baking, not necessarily made from dates, that should be ready in 2019.The hitch for now is the price. At $8.99 for an 8.8-ounce bottle, Charles‚Äô syrup is out of reach for the lower-income patients she was originally inspired by. There are less-expensive imports from the Middle East, but many of those have added cane sugar.Charles says her plan is to bring the price down to $6.99 by the end of 2019, which will still be a lot more than a bag of sugar. But she also plans to sell it to venues that serve populations at risk, such as hospitals.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ground zero for someone who needs a lifestyle change,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúPart of my goal will be to shift that paradigm to bring delicious items into the hospital that are better for you.‚Äù

92.0,Other,"When Lers Ros opened its original location on Larkin Street in 2008, chef Tom Silargorn‚Äôs cooking introduced me to wonders like crisp pork belly stir-fried with basil leaves, and spiky, bone-in bits of eel sauteed with galangal and sprigs of young green peppercorns. His steamed whole sea bass was a joy. I remember marveling one afternoon as a flatbed truck pulled up outside the restaurant and a deliveryman scooped live fish from a makeshift tank and plopped them into a bin held by one of the restaurant‚Äôs cooks.I‚Äôm hopeful that some of this freshness remains intact at the Tenderloin restaurant, but during a recent lunch at the Hayes Valley branch, my kai yang ‚Äî that perfect and classic dish of grilled chicken and rice ‚Äî tasted old and unloved. My bird had undoubtedly been sitting on a rack with other precooked legs and thighs, waiting to be warmed and dumped onto a plate during the afternoon rush. The place was packed on a weekday with diners ordering lunch combination plates (two entrees, rice and a bleak iceberg salad for 10 bucks). I don‚Äôt exactly blame Lers Ros for playing it safe with user-friendly combo plates. The full-length menu is loaded with potential booby traps ‚Äî as in, places where you might inadvertently step beyond your comfort level in regards to spice, funk or acidity ‚Äî and I understand Silargorn wanting to provide diners with a safe path through the chile-laden woods.The year-old Saap Ver and its chef, Nutnawat Aukcarapasutanun (a.k.a. Kobe), have taken up the torch of giving San Franciscans a peek behind the pad Thai curtains. The menu at the Design District restaurant promises ‚Äúauthentic country-style Thai cuisine,‚Äù and a short rant printed on the front page laments other Thai restaurants‚Äô hackneyed names and explains that ‚ÄúSaap Ver‚Äù (‚Äúdamn delicious,‚Äù according to the text) is a break from the expected.Aside from a glass of Champagne garnished with gold leaf, the menu appears promisingly rugged. (For funsies, my wife ordered said Champagne. It arrived sans gold leaf. I suppose we‚Äôre not the first San Franciscans to be lured in and deceived by the promise of gold.) There are two different northern Thai sausages on offer, three variations on nam phrik, a few head-turning som tum (green papaya salads), and a grilled beef dish called Crying Thai Girl. I neglected to inquire about the name, and take it from me, you shouldn‚Äôt Google it.(To be fair to Lers Ros, Saap Ver also offers lunch combinations, but like I said, I‚Äôm willing to see past that.)While placing my order ‚Äî hot-and-sour pork rib soup, fried fish larb, a plate of fermented pork-and-rice sausage and salted crab som tum ‚Äî the server asked me how spicy I wanted each item.‚ÄúHow spicy should it be?‚Äù I responded.‚ÄúHow spicy do you want it?‚Äù she repeated, as though I hadn‚Äôt heard her the first time.‚ÄúCould you just make it as spicy as it‚Äôs supposed to be?‚ÄùIt felt like communication was breaking down, so in order to save some face ‚Äî hers or mine, I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äî I ended up ordering everything spicy or medium spicy.Look, I get it. I didn‚Äôt take offense to the question, and I wasn‚Äôt trying to be pretentious. I was honestly looking for some guidance. Nobody ever asks me how salty I want a dish, or how acidic, or how bitter. But spice, for some reason, seems to be a scalable flavor component that‚Äôs left to the diner‚Äôs discretion, and I‚Äôm not so sure it should be up to us.The best Thai meals I‚Äôve ever had were balancing acts. Where Western cooks talk about balance as something to be achieved within the confines of a single dish, in Thai cooking, equilibrium is accomplished across an entire meal. On the table, there might be a face-meltingly spicy relish (nam phrik) next to a milder, coconut-milk-based curry. Sharp, acidic salads cut through fatty grilled meats. Rice acts as a sort of all-purpose tempering device. If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre bound to wander into some unstable territory.On this occasion at Saap Ver, the pork soup was outstanding, sour and spicy and smelling strongly of lemongrass and makrut lime. Throughout the murky broth bobbed tender bone-in ribs that tasted extra porky in that way you can only achieve when you forgo browning. From there, however, things went a little off the rails. The batter-fried cubes of tilapia on the massive plate of larb had been over-fried into fish croutons, yet still tasted distinctly muddy ‚Äî a flavor that even large quantities of lime, onion and herbs couldn‚Äôt overcome. But other than that, our dinner‚Äôs downward trajectory was mostly my fault.I‚Äôm not afraid to tell you that I didn‚Äôt know what I was getting into when I ordered the field-crab som tum. I‚Äôd chosen it sheerly out of curiosity and for whatever reason, I assumed the shells would be soft, or a parental figure would warn me about biting down on hard bits of crab. Only after chomping down on a solid piece of carapace did I realize I was meant to suck the sweet, slippery crab meat out of the shells.The sausages came with a plate of accoutrements that I recognized from ordering the same fermentation-soured dish in Thailand: brunoise of ginger and skin-on lime, roasted peanuts, cabbage leaves and nubs of chile. The idea, as it had been demonstrated for me before, is to jab a bit of chile into the sausage, wrap it in cabbage with the other garnishes, and pop the whole thing in your mouth. It‚Äôs a dish that requires cold beer, maybe some other grilled meats, sticky rice and little else. I know that, and yet, I looked around my table and saw a tureen of hot soup, an enormous mound of fried fish, and a napkin wadded around shards of spit-out crab shells. Nothing made sense together. What had I done?To make myself feel better, I decided I deserved a guilty-pleasure plate of pad Thai hor kai ‚Äî everyone‚Äôs favorite sweet-sour noodles wrapped in a thin egg omelet. Does that logic make any sense? No, nothing I was doing made any sense.In his review of Lers Ros for SF Weekly five years ago, my friend Jonathan Kauffman noted that as much as he liked the place, he‚Äôd never felt like he‚Äôd ordered correctly from the restaurant‚Äôs menu of more than 100 items. I feel you, Jonathan.I also can‚Äôt help but think of a kerfuffle that took place about a year ago, when Bon Appetit published a video online under the title ‚ÄúPSA: This Is How You Should Be Eating Pho.‚Äù BA caught all kinds of flak for portraying a white chef as the face of Vietnamese noodles, and I agree that the video was tone-deaf, but there‚Äôs also some truth to the idea that there‚Äôs often a right and wrong way of eating something. It‚Äôs not right because it‚Äôs traditional or authentic, but because your meal will be better if you taste your pho broth before doctoring it with Sriracha and hoisin, or if you think about how the various dishes you‚Äôre ordering at a Thai restaurant interact with one another.Saap Ver and Lers Ros could both stand to shorten and focus their menus. I also wouldn‚Äôt mind a little more guidance from the servers and less input from me about how hot I‚Äôd like the cooks to make the food. I understand why yellow curry is always on the menu, and why customers are given the option of ordering domesticated versions of spicy dishes. But I also have faith that if you remove the safety nets, San Francisco diners will reward you with their trust. Look at what Pim Techamuanvivit has achieved at Kin Khao, for instance.For now, I‚Äôll just try to do better. On my second trip to Saap Ver, I was more careful. We had garlicky sauteed cabbage, fried fish cakes and duck salad. As the centerpiece of our meal, I ordered a pungent, shrimp-paste nam phrik with steamed vegetables and fried sardines for dipping (tasty but skimpy on the sauce itself; plus the sardines were cooked to hell). If I‚Äôd stopped there, we‚Äôd have had a sensible, harmonious meal. But because I can‚Äôt help myself, at the last second, I added a plate of pad kee mao ‚Äî literally, a dish of stir-fried rice noodles invented to sober up wayward drunks.Nobody stopped me.

49.0,Food,"With the sale of a few to-go boxes of $18 chicken and waffles, and a couple of $4 buttermilk biscuits, chef Tanya Holland marked the official opening of her long-awaited Brown Sugar Kitchen at the Ferry Building Tuesday morning.Not only is it Holland‚Äôs first restaurant in San Francisco, it‚Äôs also the first black-owned restaurant to ever open in the Ferry Building.The Ferry Building soul food spot is a streamlined, counter-service version of Holland‚Äôs West Oakland restaurant, which closed in 2018 after nearly a decade in the East Bay. The new menu has been distilled down to Brown Sugar Kitchen‚Äôs greatest hits ‚Äî waffles, cheese grits with a poached egg, smoked chicken and shrimp gumbo and the blackened catfish poboy, among other things.Holland‚Äôs Ferry Building project has been a lesson in patience not only for the chef, but for those who follow her movements. She originally leased the former Il Cane Russo space about three years ago. The process stalled when Holland ran into funding issues. Eventually she connected with Salt Partners Group (the same folks behind Saison, Petit Crenn and Humphry Slocombe) to launch Brown Sugar Kitchen Hospitality Group. The entity consists of Brown Sugar Kitchen at the Ferry Building as well as Holland‚Äôs forthcoming Brown Sugar Kitchen in Uptown Oakland. If all goes as planned, Holland has said the Ferry Building is just the first chapter in her launch of a national soul food empire. But the grand ambitions have to begin humbly enough ‚Äî with a counter at a tourist-friendly spot in San Francisco. Here are five things to know about the Ferry Building‚Äôs Brown Sugar Kitchen:1. Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles...Brown Sugar Kitchen is synonymous with what are arguably the best chicken and waffles in the Bay Area. At the Ferry Building, Holland is selling her two-piece chicken option with a fluffy half-waffle for $18. Even in the smaller Ferry Building confines, Holland hasn‚Äôt missed a step in the kitchen and the dish is worth a trip to the Embarcadero.2. Expect lines.On Tuesday morning, there were solo diners picking up multiple orders of chicken and waffles. Most said they worked in the area and had been keeping track of Holland‚Äôs debut. Brown Sugar Kitchen is Oakland‚Äôs most recognizable soul food business. And with Holland‚Äôs national celebrity expanding, thanks in part to her ‚ÄúTop Chef‚Äù appearance, expect anyone and everyone to flock to the city‚Äôs first location.3. Keep track of the time.Brown Sugar Kitchen will be open all day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. but the menu transitions for the lunch crowds by midday. Before 11 a.m., it‚Äôs mostly breakfast ‚Äî granola, egg tarts, breakfast potatoes. After 11 a.m., people can order barbecue pulled pork sandwiches, the catfish poboy and the vegetarian muffuletta. Don‚Äôt worry, the chicken and waffles are available all day.4. This is only the beginning.Brown Sugar Kitchen opening at the Ferry Building comes about two weeks before Holland opens the doors to a new Brown Sugar Kitchen in Oakland‚Äôs bustling Uptown neighborhood. Holland has plans to open other Brown Sugar Kitchens across the Bay Area, including at Oakland‚Äôs International Airport and there‚Äôs a chance the chef gets involved with the food services at the Golden State Warriors‚Äô Chase Center in Mission Bay.5. Don‚Äôt forget about the sides.Brown Sugar Kitchen‚Äôs star menu item might be the chicken and waffles, but the restaurant has some of the best Southern and soul food-influenced sides in the Bay Area. Holland‚Äôs signature black-eyed pea salad, her macaroni and cheese and the cast iron skillet corn bread with house-made butter are all at the Ferry Building. The sides are all priced between $4 and $6.Brown Sugar Kitchen: Ferry Building at 1 The Embarcadero; Open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m."
88.0,Food,"Welcome to Housemade, a Chronicle column by culinary scientist Ali Bouzari. Here, we will take diners on a guided tour of the silent science, brilliant ideas and awesome techniques behind your favorite restaurant menus.At Chez Panisse, the Berkeley restaurant where Alice Waters once mined large chunks of the bedrock that supports modern American fine dining, co-chefs Amy Dencler and Jennifer Sherman prepare multicourse tasting menus in the downstairs dining room, while Nathan Alderson and Beth Wells serve dinner a la carte in the upstairs cafe. Pastry chefs¬†Mary Jo Thoresen¬†and Carrie Lewis supply both levels with desserts.For nearly half a century, generations of talented Chez Panisse chefs have stoked the international renown of the legendary restaurant while following a culinary strategy that defies the rhythms of conventional restaurant criticism. The kitchen orbits around a concrete core of classical techniques, without avant-garde flourishes for food critics to dissect. And the menu changes every day to sync with seasonal ingredient flux, so it‚Äôs difficult to nitpick details or make recommendations to future diners.In the absence of concrete menu landmarks or groundbreaking technical milestones, the national conversation surrounding Chez Panisse tends toward the wateriest of slurries of restaurant industry cliches, including debate over the value (both financial and creative) of ‚Äúsimple‚Äù or ‚Äúingredient-forward‚Äù food. Within the coliseum of debate about whether Chez Panisse merits the price of entry, the restaurant‚Äôs penchant for serving fresh fruit is a perpetual headliner.Chez Panisse is a restaurant where real strawberries can taste as loud as Jolly Ranchers, and foraged chanterelles can carry sufficient savory payload to compete with Doritos. Despite what Chez Panisse‚Äôs critics and fans alike may claim, such perfect produce doesn‚Äôt just fall out of a well-tended garden and onto your plate.Channeling Chez Panisse‚Äôs brand of electric, tongue-thumping flavor from aesthetically simple food requires the precise manipulation of some of the most complex biochemistry in the edible world. Here‚Äôs how they do it with fruit.Growth and harvestDespite the classical aesthetic, cooking ‚Äúfarm to table‚Äù food at the highest level is no less chemically complex or difficult to execute than the right-angle precision presented by more modern-leaning restaurants. Where some contemporary restaurants invest time and resources on new dish R&D, Chez Panisse devotes hundreds of hours to a Templar-level quest for the perfect citrus, persimmons, avocados, pomegranates, figs, apples, tomatoes, pears, stone fruit, table and wine grapes, melons and berries.Ingredient prep begins months, or years, before your 8 p.m. reservation and takes place in a tiny kitchen buried in dirt. Bob Cannard, one of the many farmers with whom Chez Panisse collaborates, knows that supreme fruit depends on an umbilical cocktail of elemental staples like nitrogen, potassium and calcium. To set the mood for ripening, Cannard seasons his soil with fava beans, crushed volcanic rock, oyster shells and compost. Favas and other fast-growing cover crops turn air into fertilizer by recruiting bacteria to nestle against their roots and snare nitrogen from the atmosphere. The crushed rocks and shells are crystalline caches stocked with dozens of different minerals. The compost donates billions of microbes to an already flourishing subterranean community that uses natural acids as mining tools to dissolve these mineral storehouses into a nutritious, geochemical kimchi.Sommeliers love to wax poetic about oyster shells and ancient seabeds in certains vineyards. Plants put soil through a digestive meat grinder to strip out basic nutrients, so you can‚Äôt actually taste ancient mollusks in ripe fruit or even in the most expensive Chablis. These prenatal fruit vitamins contain a functional road map to help plants navigate the convoluted labyrinth of pathways toward the most delicious fruit. Minute deficiencies in a single mineral can prevent a tomato from manufacturing umami-rich glutamate or stunt a peach from surpassing the size of an almond, so Cannard makes sure to keep his soil pantry well stocked.Harvest severs the plant-soil lifeline, leaving fruit alone in uncharted waters with only what it has stored for survival. Chez Panisse asks its farmers to allow each piece of fruit maximum time to pack its bags of deliciousness before departure to the restaurant, which, like cutting things close at the airport, rubs against the chance of complete catastrophe. Chez Panisse chefs coordinate with their pomegranate growers to push their fruit past acceptable ripeness for market-bound product, often allowing the jeweled red orbs to split open on the tree. With their delicate cargo exposed to the elements, emergency harvests often occur hours before an impending afternoon shower brings waves of blooming mold.Along with color and flavor changes, peak ripeness triggers the release of a platoon of cellular executioners that cut the cords of pectin and cellulose that tie fruit to plant. Chez Panisse chefs inspect all incoming melons at the juncture where the stem was once attached; a perfectly circular, empty stem scar indicates that the melon released itself naturally after storing as much sweetness as it could hold, whereas quarter- or half-moons of vestigial stem indicate that flavorful stockpiling was cut short by a premature harvest. Immature fruit clings to the vine, so the best figs, stone fruit and berries seem to jump into the warmth of an outstretched hand if picked at their peak.In addition to the sentimental beauty of this agricultural kismet, minimizing aggressive tugging and twisting decreases the chance of injuring the fruit during harvest. A scratch offers passage to hordes of invading microbes. A bruise crushes internal cell blocks open, allowing dangerous enzyme inmates to run amok and cause uneven rot-ripening from within. The plump drupelets on a ripe mulberry contain fragile purses of acid that can spill open to trigger color and flavor degradation with the vibrational stress of riding in a truck bed. The Chez Panisse chefs don‚Äôt source fruit locally to win sustainability kudos; they know that the physics of deliciousness can depend on traffic patterns and the age of a truck‚Äôs shock absorbers.Chez Panisse‚Äôs sourcing endeavors extend to all possible interpretations of the word ‚Äúfarm.‚Äù The magnetic pull of the restaurant‚Äôs prestige draws a steady flow of neighbors and local admirers offering fruit grown in backyards, urban gardens and even untended empty lots. As busy as it is, Chez Panisse takes these offers seriously, greeting every offer with the same discerning eye.AgingEven if you are lucky enough to live within driving distance of these farmers, you‚Äôll be hard pressed to eat fruit as good as what Chez Panisse serves, because of what happens next. When a case of presumably perfect peaches, handpicked by one of the country‚Äôs most sought-after farmers, arrives at the door, only six or so will immediately be deemed ready for the spotlight. The rest get put through a gauntlet of rigorous sorting and curating protocols under the guidance of some of the most discerning fruit affineurs in the industry.Fruit is an instrument of botanical seduction, a meticulously crafted thirst-trap designed to lure us into a mutually beneficial barter system: flavor and nutrition in exchange for spreading the seeds of a new plant generation.Picked fruit remains alive, and some fruits ‚Äî including figs, peaches, plums, apples, pears, avocados, persimmons and bananas ‚Äî have the ability to continue ripening for days and weeks after harvest. The shock of detachment from their stems causes these fruits to release an odorless perfume of plant hormones. These hormones announce a biological last call to signal the fruit‚Äôs final chance at luring in an animal suitor, kicking millions of microscopic enzyme factories online to full production, making the fruit as delicious as possible.Ripening fruits drop their protective physical coatings of tough fibers and dampen chemical deterrents like astringent tannins and abrasive acids. Deep 401(k)s of starch are liquidated to fast cash in the form of sugar, and cell walls crumble to allow easier access to the sweetened nectar when bitten. Scraps of the disintegrating structures rocket upward to explode enchanting perfume into the air, and tasteful, utilitarian, green chlorophyll cedes the floor to garish pigments of every other color, a botanical ‚ÄúEverything Must Go‚Äù banner hung high.In the industrial fruit supply chain, these ripening changes are shepherded under the watchful eye of color, texture and aroma-quantifying instruments, each costing tens of thousands of dollars. Chez Panisse trains its chefs to replace those analytical labs with their senses.At the restaurant, deliveries of fast-ripening fruit are immediately sorted and laid out onto single-layer trays that are tagged and retagged with information tracking their progress across the waves of cooks who roll in and out of the restaurant between shifts. By logging the stem-end firmness of a pear, the character and intensity of a plum‚Äôs perfume, or the characteristic wrinkling pattern of a black mission fig, these notes act like nautical star charts to indicate whether a specific piece of fruit will be perfect in two days, that evening, or between 1 and 3 hours from last touch.Most home cooks are familiar with the paper bag trick ‚Äî putting underripe fruit into a paper bag for quick ripening. The paper works by trapping and concentrating ethylene, the hormone responsible for most plant ripening. At the same time, it allows oxygen, which can halt ripening, to escape. Chez Panisse carries so much fruit in house at any given time that ethylene is never in short supply, so instead of a paper bag, the chefs rely on several tiers of open-air storage solutions.Most fruit at Chez Panisse starts its ripening journey in what the kitchen crew calls the ‚Äúcondos,‚Äù a series of shaded, netted, outdoor shelves in the back of the restaurant that allows the fruit to ramp up enzymes in the open air. During multiple sortings each day, any fruit that shows a steady head of ripening steam or becomes at risk for suffering in the elements (be it muggy summer days or rainy winter chills) moves indoors. This rhythmic shuffling continues, pushing and pulling each piece of fruit to reach peak ripeness, until it either gets served or moved into refrigeration to slow the furnace within and prolong its zenith for a few hours longer. However, prolonged refrigeration is minimized whenever possible (and never with tomatoes), since cold temperatures short-circuit ripening at the level of the fruit‚Äôs DNA, discouraging enzymes from releasing the heady fragrances that we love.ServiceThere exists a supreme throne within the elite kingdom of Chez Panisse fruit ‚Äî the Fruit Bowl. Every day, a gleaming selection of fresh fruit is presented as one of the signature desserts in the upstairs cafe and stars as an occasional guest ingredient in the multicourse meals downstairs.These fruits receive the same timing finesse and attention to serving temperature that a medium-rare steak or a perfectly tempered triple cream cheese demand. Cooks in the Chez Panisse open kitchen constantly poke, squeeze and smell each piece of fruit down to the minute they hit the plate. The fig you receive at 8 p.m. may not have been perfect for the table that sat at 5:30 p.m.When it finally reaches you, the fruit at Chez Panisse gleams with alchemical enhancement from the hours, weeks and sometimes years of coddling leading up to its arrival. Mandarins reek with enough volatile essential oil to classify their zest as a fire hazard. Peaches jiggle with the weight of sorbet-sweet juice packed into millions of sheer cellular pouches ready to burst at the seams. Asian pears flaunt adornments of eugenol and vanillin, naturally occurring chemical accessories that create the illusion of invisible mulling spices somehow sequestered beneath their speckled skins. Olallieberries pulled from the most enzymatically active part of the bramble spill enough pigment to turn every piece of white linen in the building scarlet.Anything deemed incapable of sustaining these unreasonably high standards of fruit beauty gets labeled Not For Fruit Bowl (‚ÄúNFFB‚Äù). NFFB fruit would still inspire awe in the kitchens of most other restaurants, so the Chez Panisse chefs put it to work in a variety of cooked applications.Fragrant fruit that lacks the right acid and sugar ratio to shine on its own becomes a redolent memory when steeped in a wine-based aperitif. Pears that stubbornly clung to a few too many starchy granules finally yield to custardy submission when poached in wine or syrup. The zests of cosmetically imperfect lemons, grapefruits, mandarins and oranges find crystalline immortality when carefully removed and candied. Overripe dates and persimmons, which contain the cellular machinery to produce enough sugar to candy themselves, collapse into a complex molasses that forms the bases of more complex desserts. The cafe serves galettes that give wayward fruit slices a home nestled within crumbly pastry. Chez Panisse also makes ice cream and sherbet out of nearly everything, using the gobs of sugar and pectin hoarded by ripe fruit as natural stabilizers to rein in ice crystals for the smoothest possible texture. Even the paper that lines trays of carefully stored berries finds a second life; after shuffling the berries to a new tray, Chez Panisse often dries the kaleidoscopically stained parchment for use as gift wrapping paper.Without the constant curation leading up to service, the style of fruit presentation favored at Chez Panisse would fall flat on its face. To maintain its ludicrously high standards year after year, Chez Panisse nurses relationships with its produce suppliers. The chefs share photos and stories of fruit that soared to the greatest heights with the farmers that delivered them, creating a feedback loop rather than a one-way conversation. This enables a flavor triangulation so specific that individual trees on some farms are marked for Chez Panisse use only.***Legions of fans applaud Chez Panisse for ‚Äúrespecting ingredients,‚Äù but Chez Panisse chefs don‚Äôt just meekly obey the wishes of pristine fruits, vegetables, meat, seafood, grains, nuts and dairy as they arrive from their various exalted origins. They expertly prod and tug each unique piece of food along its natural path until it becomes a living distillate of ideal taste and aroma.When Chez Panisse chefs serve a perfectly orchestrated opus of plant biochemistry in a fruit bowl or navigate a whole leg of lamb as it roasts over an open fire in their hearth, they aren‚Äôt hiding behind some romantic facade as an excuse not to cook difficult dishes. They are flexing their formidable culinary talent to build a shrine to the delicious results that can come from engaging head-on with the irregular edges and awkward curves of the natural world.

94.0,Food,"Super Bowl Sunday is approaching, which means it‚Äôs time to start thinking about game-day snacks.There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a tried-and-true spread of chips and dips, but why not mix it up with this twist on the classic pub staple of stuffed potato skins from Wine Country chef Curtis Di Fede?Until 2014, Di Fede was the chef and partner at Oenotri, a highly praised southern Italian-influenced restaurant in Napa that was a frequent member of The Chronicle‚Äôs Top 100 Restaurants list.For his next project,  Di Fede pulled a culinary 180 by opening izakaya-style Miminashi (821 Coombs St., Napa). In addition to skewers of grilled meats, the menu ranges from traditional Japanese favorites like chawanmushi to more unexpected drinks-friendly bites like these stuffed potato skins.Di Fede starts by brining Russet potatoes for 12 hours, then twice-baking them to achieve crisp vessels that are topped with a decadent combo of creme fraiche and a super-melty cheese like raclette or Gruyere. To balance the richness, and for a boost of umami power, add a healthy dose of kimchi, fresh green onions and a sprinkling of bonito flakes. Now you‚Äôve got yourself a killer finger food that‚Äôs a game-changer.Sarah Fritsche is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: sfritsche@sfchronicle.com. Twitter/Instagram: @foodcentricServes 4 to 64 medium Russet potatoes¬Ω cup kosher salt2 tablespoons safflower oil¬º cup creme fraiche, room temperature1 bunch green onions, chopped¬Ω cup kimchi, room temperature¬º cup grated raclette or Gruyere cheese, room temperatureBonito flakes to garnishInstructions: Fill a large pot with 1 gallon of water. Add the salt and stir to dissolve. Add the potatoes and weight them so they sink beneath the water line. Brine for 12 hours.Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Remove the potatoes from the brine and blot dry with paper towels. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast until fork tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Allow to cool to the touch.Increase heat to 500 degrees.Cut the potatoes in half and scoop out the centers. (Save the potato centers for another use.) Brush the potato skins with the oil and roast for 10 to 12 minutes.Place a spoonful of creme fraiche, green onions, kimchi and raclette on the hot potato skins and place them back into the oven for a couple of minutes to brown. (Keep a close eye so they don‚Äôt burn.) Remove from the oven and sprinkle the potatoes with bonito flakes. Serve immediately.Brine time: Much like one might brine a pork chop, allowing the potatoes to sit in a saltwater solution for several hours helps the potatoes to absorb some of the salty liquid, which both flavors the interior and helps keep things moist when baked. Make sure to weigh down the potatoes so they stay submerged.Waste not, want not: You won‚Äôt end up using the cooked interiors for the potato skins, but by no means discard them. There‚Äôs loads of flavor there and they‚Äôll make a great base for potato salad, croquettes or even plain old mashed potatoes.A study in contrasts: Aside from the major burst of umami, what‚Äôs so satisfying about these potato skins is the contrast of crisp skin and creamy creme fraiche and gooey cheese. And the fresh chopped green onions balance the fermented funk of the kimchi.Double up: For a larger crowd or heartier appetites, this recipe can be easily doubled."
105.0,Food,"A few months ago, UC Davis professor emeritus Linda Bisson ‚Äî who has some great quotes in my column this week ‚Äî told me something that completely blew my mind.Bisson taught an introductory wine production course at Davis for some 30 years. One of the class objectives was to teach students to identify wine flaws, such as 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), otherwise known as cork taint. Students would be given a sampling of corks, some infected with TCA and some not, and asked to separate them.‚ÄúIn the beginning it was one out of 100 students, maybe one out of 200, who couldn‚Äôt detect TCA,‚Äù says Bisson. ‚ÄúBut then, over time, it started to be higher and higher percentages of the students.‚Äù Was an entire generation becoming immune to that aroma ‚Äî revolting to many wine drinkers, including yours truly ‚Äî that makes a wine smell like wet cardboard and chlorine?Then Bisson realized the culprit: baby carrots.‚ÄúThose plastic bags of baby carrots ‚Äî they spin them down, shape them, then bleach them, before putting them in plastic,‚Äù Bisson says, ‚Äúwhich puts them at a high risk for developing TCA.‚Äù The same chemical compound that can infect wine corks, in other words, has infected bags upon bags of processed carrots at the grocery store. Her students had grown up eating these carrots and had become inured to the taste and smell of TCA. In fact, they liked it.‚ÄúTo them it wasn‚Äôt negative,‚Äù she continues. Baby carrots, for her students, connoted snacks packed by mom in the lunchbox; the taste was linked to pleasant memories of childhood. ‚ÄúThey were perfectly happy drinking this wine that would turn our stomachs.‚ÄùThis TCA discussion brings up many of the same issues I encountered when researching my column for this week‚Äôs Food section, about the spoilage yeast brettanomyces. Why, I wondered, has a growing contingent of craft brewers embraced brett, which most wine and beer drinkers have long associated with offputting flavors like horse manure and Band-Aid? I became especially interested in this question when I found out that Napa winemaker Mandy Heldt Donovan, of Merisi Wines, is making an intentionally bretty Pinot Gris. (Maybe not coincidentally, Donovan worked in Bisson‚Äôs lab as a graduate student.)My central question is: Can our tastes collectively change over time, as baby carrots seem to have shifted the palates of the latest generation of Bisson‚Äôs students? And is it possible to unlearn what we find disgusting ‚Äî to rewrite those emotional associations we have with certain flavors or aromas?Funny enough, these questions intersect with another story I‚Äôm publishing this week ‚Äî and this one isn‚Äôt a wine story at all. It‚Äôs about a different Mandy, Mandy Aftel, a well-known producer of natural perfumes in Berkeley who now operates a ‚Äúsmell museum,‚Äù the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents. I highly recommend a visit to the museum, where you can smell substances including hyraceum (the urine and feces of the hyrax, a small, furry mammal) and ambergris (essentially, whale vomit). Trust me when I tell you that both smell amazing ‚Äî floral, earthy, sweet, fruity.I definitely never thought I‚Äôd find the smell of animal poop preferable to a baby carrot.Want to get the wine world in your inbox every week?

Cider checks all the boxes of current culinary trends: it‚Äôs fermented, it‚Äôs low in alcohol, and it‚Äôs got small-scale agricultural credentials. As our culture embraces flavors of funk with increasing enthusiasm (see above re: whale vomit, horse manure, etc.), the traditional, bacterial ciders of Spain and France seem ideally poised for a big debut.Enter Redfield, a new cider bar and bottle shop in Oakland that aims to make cider approachable and enjoyable for all sorts of palates ‚Äî for lovers of sour beer and natural wine as well as lovers of off-dry Moscato.

164.0,Other,"Nigel Jones knows the soft, yellowish flesh of the African fruit ackee is almost as rare  a sight on a Bay Area restaurant menu as saltfish, a Caribbean staple usually made from cured cod.The same can be said for fesenjan, a deeply flavorful Iranian stew, or nasi lemak, a fragrant Malaysian rice dish.The Bay Area restaurant scene might be hailed as one of the country‚Äôs most vibrant, but there‚Äôs a problem with the widely accepted sentiment, according to Jones ‚Äî it dismisses the region‚Äôs notable lack of Afro-Caribbean, Malaysian and Persian food businesses.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just no representation, really, for these places,‚Äù said Jones, who is the chef-owner of Caribbean spots Kaya in San Francisco and Kingston 11 in Oakland. ‚ÄúSo, the question is how do we start to fix this?‚ÄùAfter two years of contemplation, Jones has an answer: Calabash, a restaurant and marketplace in Oakland. The name is a reference to the  gourd commonly found in Africa and the Caribbean. Depending on when it‚Äôs harvested, the calabash can be used for various functions.‚ÄúIt can be food as a fruit, or it can be dried out and used as a bowl to carry water. Some Jamaicans have used it as a pipe. In the Middle East it can be used to make a setar,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúCalabash goes across a lot of different cultures and nationalities. It represents more than just a fruit or vegetable. That‚Äôs why we picked that name.‚ÄùThe project will open as part of a housing development on the 2300 block of Valdez, essentially right behind Oakland‚Äôs popular AlaMar Kitchen. The business at this point is little more than blueprints and renderings, which depict a 3,000-square-foot dining area and a nearly 900-square-foot mezzanine, but Jones and his team are hoping to open it by September.Joining Jones in the Oakland venture is Malaysian chef Azalina Eusope, the chef-owner of Azalina‚Äôs in San Francisco. Calabash is just the latest project for Eusope, who grew up in Penang, an island in northwest Malaysia. She operates a permanent counter in the Market Street food hall and is heading to Noe Valley with a new restaurant at 1320 Castro St., the former home of Contigo.Rounding out the group of Calabash talent is Iranian chef Hanif Sadr who runs Komaaj, a pop-up restaurant and catering company in Berkeley. Sadr‚Äôs food focuses on the flavors of northern Iran ‚Äî think tea, rice and citrus from the Caspian Sea that are all turned into the flour for gluten-free breads.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place like this in the entire country,‚Äù Jones said, speaking of the project.Calabash, on the restaurant side, will have one menu, Jones said. All of the chefs will contribute dishes to it. Where they‚Äôll branch apart will be in the marketplace.‚ÄúIf you look at places like Whole Foods, the prepared foods component is really successful. It‚Äôs something that just works in the industry today because people want to be able to grab something and get home,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúWith this, we can give more of a platform to Afro-Caribbean food, to Malaysian food, to Persian food. Now people can pick these things up and take them home, become more familiar with them.‚ÄùCalabash will have a counter-service area and eventually, the business will incorporate take-out and delivery app-ordering services, Jones said. There will also be a full bar, the cocktails, beers and wines the trio of chefs plan to select together.Jones said he sees Calabash as more than a restaurant and market. It‚Äôs a platform for chefs of color, a place where Afro-Caribbean, Malaysian and Iranian families will be able find homespun comfort food.Calabash, he said, is about inclusion. And he believes it could change the Oakland restaurant industry.‚ÄúFrom here, these other chefs can open spin-offs and side projects,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúThis is only the beginning.‚Äù"
35.0,Other,"SRINAGAR, India (AP) ‚Äî As India considers its response to the suicide car bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed dozens of soldiers, a retired military commander who oversaw a much-lauded military strike against neighboring Pakistan in 2016 has urged caution.A local Kashmiri militant rammed an explosive-laden van into a convoy bus on Thursday, killing 41 soldiers and injuring two dozen others in the worst attack against Indian government forces in Kashmir's history. A pre-recorded video circulated widely on social media showed the purported attacker, Adil Ahmed Dar, in combat clothes surrounded by guns and grenades claiming responsibility for the attack and calling for more such measures to drive India out of Kashmir.India blamed the attack on Pakistan and¬†promised a ""crushing response."" New Delhi accuses its archrival of supporting rebels in Kashmir, a charge that Islamabad denies.Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety. Rebels have been fighting Indian rule since 1989, demanding Kashmir be made part of Pakistan or become an independent country. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown.The retired Indian military commander, Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda, told The Associated Press on Saturday that while ""some kind of limited (military) strike (against Pakistan) is more than likely,"" he hopes for ""rethinking and reconciliation"" from all sides in the conflict.The former general, who commanded the Indian army's northern command in charge of the frontier with Pakistan in Kashmir and counterinsurgency operations, oversaw India's ""surgical strikes"" in September 2016 after militants attacked a military base in the frontier town of Uri near the highly militarized Line of Control in Indian-controlled Kashmir.Nineteen Indian soldiers and three assailants were killed in that attack. India instantly blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, who New Delhi alleged were Pakistani nationals.At the peak of a 2016 civilian uprising triggered by the killing of a charismatic Kashmiri rebel leader, Hooda called for all sides to take a step back from the deadly confrontation, suggesting that political initiatives be taken instead, a rare move by a top Indian army general in Kashmir.Later that year when the attack on the base in Uri happened, Hooda commanded what New Delhi called ""surgical strikes"" against militants in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir ‚Äî which India said involved the country's special forces killing an unknown number of insurgents. Pakistan denied that the strikes ever occurred, demanding that India produce evidence to back up the claim.Hooda has since criticized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for ""politicizing"" the strikes, saying that celebrating the anniversary with a three-day event in central New Delhi full of military pomp and circumstance was ""unwarranted.""Since 2016, soldiers from India and Pakistan have often traded fire along the frontier, blaming each other for initiating the skirmishes that have resulted in the deaths of dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides in violation of a 2003 cease-fire accord.Hooda said Saturday that considering the state of affairs in Kashmir, he wasn't surprised by the bombing.""I just hope this all leads to some introspection, some deep thinking and engagement to do everything afresh and rethink what we all should be doing to settle issues once for all,"" he said.___"

106.0,Other,"Welcome to the 2017 edition of Bargain Chronicles, wherein we explore some of San Francisco‚Äôs most delicious neighborhoods and choose our favorite meals that can be enjoyed for $20 and under. See also: The Inner Richmond, the Mission's 24th Street, Bernal Heights, the Bayview¬†and the Tenderloin. Quick lunch at Hon's Wun-Tun HouseWhat: Wonton noodle with brisket ($7.80)When: 9:30 a.m.-7 p.m. daily.Customers cycle through Hon's Wun-Tun House almost as fast as they do McDonald's. The time between ordering, receiving your lunch and paying the bill is 30 minutes if you're talking between bites. There's a timeless quality to the lunch counter and canary-yellow Formica tables, and to the small menu, which owner Ng Yuen Wah hasn't changed since she bought the business she had worked at for three decades before. Dried flounder and shrimp shells give depth to the clear pork and chicken broth, and the braised beef spooned over is seasoned lightly enough to not overpower it. The wontons in the restaurant's name are, in fact, good. But most diners are there for the fine-gauge wheat noodles, made in-house, which arrive almost crunchy, calibrated so they grow soft just as you're inhaling the last one.648 Kearny St. (at Commercial); (415) 433-3966.Roast meats at Hing LungWhat: Barbecue duck ($11 for half, with rice) and crispy-skin pork ($7.99 a pound)When: 8 a.m.-5:30 p.m. dailyLike many meat shops on Stockton, Hing Lung has two cases: one for raw meat, another for cooked. The Cheung family loads up the steam table with braised meats, chicken wings and fried fish, but their Cantonese roast meats are currently the best in the neighborhood, perhaps the city. (Side note: Hing Lung disconnected from the jook restaurant of the same name long ago.) Head roaster Eric Cheung says he skips shortcuts other butchers take to keep their prices down. Under his aegis, the fat underneath the crackling, sweet skin of the roast duck has been reduced to a phantom gloss, having accomplished its task of keeping the meat tender, and the skin on the siu yok (roast pork) has bubbled and unfurled into a toasty sheet. A scoop of rice makes either meat a meal. Grab an apple from a corner market if you need it to be a balanced one.1261 Stockton St. (at Broadway); (415) 397-5521. Jook at Happy Chinese RestaurantWhat: Pork and preserved egg rice porridge ($6)When: 7 a.m.-3 p.m. daily.After health inspectors forced the closure of Hing Lung Restaurant (not the butcher shop above) in 2012, Chinatown lost its best-known destination for jook. Happy Chinese Restaurant, which serves dim sum and other home-style foods at lunch, may be Hing Lung‚Äôs quiet successor. Jook dwells in that soothing state between liquid and solid, deliberate in its blandness. Happy‚Äôs porridge with pork and preserved egg, however, is more complex than that. Among the chunks of preserved eggs and flecks of braised pork, which varies from tender to a welcome al dente, are strands of ginger, plus enough chopped cilantro and scallions to crunch aromatically in every bite. This is jook that never quite comes at you from the same direction. It may take the entire bowl to sense its depths.1326 Powell St. (at Broadway); (415) 398-1268. Spareribs at Dol Ho   What: Black bean spareribs over rice ($3.75)When: 8 a.m.-3 p.m. Thu.-Tue.One part cafeteria, one part living room, Dol Ho looks like a portal to the Chinatown of the 1940s. Linoleum reaches up the walls, and the bodies squeezed around its tables offer the only acoustic buffer for the considerable conversation they generate. The average age of the lunch clientele rarely dips below 70, and they are not there to eat and run. Much of the dim sum at Dol Ho is functional, but when a tray emerges from the kitchen covered in conical silvery cups, diners pounce. The best of these mini meals contain white rice topped with chunks of steamed spare ribs and a scattering of black beans. In the steamer, the pork grows smooth and bouncy, without losing that genteel snap where muscle connects to bone. Its juices infuse the rice below. A cup of spare ribs, and a tin pot of watery tea, provides enough sustenance to make it through a morning‚Äôs gossip, and half a newspaper to boot.808 Pacific Ave. (at Stockton); (415) 392-2828. Noodles at Chong Qing Xiao MianWhat: Guilin rice noodles ($10.95)When: 11 a.m.- 9 p.m. daily.Chong Qing Xiao Mian is part of Jenny Wu and Truman Du‚Äôs growing chain of Sichuan restaurants (in Chinatown there‚Äôs also Spicy King and Pot & Noodle), and perhaps the highest volume. The waiters are barely able to ferry a bowl of noodles to one of the tables before another two appear in the kitchen window. Chong Qing‚Äôs Guilin rice noodles, a dish famous in its hometown of the same name, are hardly Sichuan, and not necessarily true to what you‚Äôd find in Guilin. But they‚Äôre arguably the best noodles on the menu, a collage of overlapping flavors: the chile heat that clings to every noodle as you inhale it, the braised brisket, the crunch of peanuts and tart pickled long beans, the gush of yolk from a tiny quail egg, the steady succulence of the pork broth underneath.915 Kearny St. (at Jackson); (415) 983-0888.Vegetarian plate at Lucky CreationWhat: Gluten combo ($5.50 for a small), mixed vegetables in golden nest ($9.10)When: 11 a.m.-8:30 p.m. Thu.-Tue.For 30 years Sau Ling Lam Kwan and her husband, Lam Kwok Leung, have been serving vegetarian Buddhist food from this narrow storefront with mirrored walls and teal Formica tables. Few meals start without a plate of the couple's wheat gluten puff combination, in which handmade seitan has been fried, pressed and braised into a host of forms, from dense, barbecue pork-like chunks to curry-scented pillows. The combo plate is legendary among San Francisco vegetarians, and justifiably so. Undergoing a similar series of transformations are mashed taro root, soybean curd and mushrooms, savory and filling without trying, and failing, to approximate meat.854 Washington St. (at Ross); (415) 989-0818.Takeout tour of ChinatownWhat: Whatever strikes your fancy.When: As soon as possible.The greatness of Chinatown's takeout bakeries and dim sum shops is, unfortunately, not concentrated in one location. If you start at 11 a.m., you could spend your lunch hour weaving in and out of crowds, assembling a meal from the neighborhood's best takeout food.At Good Mong Kok (1039 Stockton St.), depart with a container of har gow ($2.10 for 3) and fried sesame balls ($1.80 for 3), then stop in next door at New Golden Daisy (1041 Stockton St.) for a bucket of fried chicken drumettes ($5/pound), marinated with ginger juice and dusted lightly in rice flour. As you're walking toward Broadway, stop by the Taiwanese-inspired Little Swan Bakery (1249 Stockton St.) for a slice of its ethereal mango mille-crepe cake ($5) to save for later.Loop down the hill to New Hollywood Bakery (652 Pacific Ave.) for arguably the neighborhood's best baked barbecue-pork buns ($1.20), pineapple buns with custard ($1.20), and warm green onion twists (70 cents), which you must not wait even 30 minutes to devour. And then, only then, should you attempt Golden Gate Bakery (1029 Grant Ave.). There, either the ""On vacation"" sign or the Disneyland-worthy line disappoints seekers of egg tarts ($1.95) time and time again. This is when the crepe cake comes in handy.  Home-style¬†Cantonese at New Woey Loy Goey   What: Two can feast for $36 on spicy salt and pepper capelin ($8.50), pan-fried pork hash with salted fish ($10.50), and snow pea leaf with garlic ($12)When: 11 a.m.-9:30 p.m. daily.New Woey Loy Goey, one of the last three below-ground restaurants in Chinatown, simultaneously operates as two restaurants: One caters to the stream of tourists, the other to diners looking for home-style Cantonese food. If you don‚Äôt speak Cantonese, it can take a visit or two to convince the servers you don‚Äôt have sweet-and-sour tastes, but get beyond that and you‚Äôll find precise, resonant cooking. Take the pan-fried pork hash, a sort of fried meatball that hides the sweet crunch of water chestnuts. Or the capelin, smelt-sized fish coated in a fine layer of flour and fried completely crisp and oil-free, impossible to stop eating. A party of four, ordering well, will have a hard time spending more than $60. A single diner would do well to stop by at lunch, when rice plates (lamb with dried bean cake, rock cod with greens) cost less than $7.699 Jackson St. (at Clay); (415) 399-0733 Chicken pho at San Sun   What: Pho ga or chicken-leek dumpling noodle ($6.50 for a small)When: 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Mon.-Sun. daily.Every corner of San Sun gleams, from the gold columns and mirrored walls to the silvery bowls, cups and chopsticks. Its spiral-bound menu resembles an encyclopedia of Vietnamese noodle soups: beef pho and hu tieu, multiple combinations of meatballs, pork kidney noodles, and noodles with a saday-sauce broth. All are available with your choice of a half-dozen noodle shapes. It seems almost perverse to recommend two of the simpler soups based on chicken stock. Yet the broth is so clear, so present, that the soup doesn‚Äôt need much more than a bit of shredded meat, toasted shallots and scallions, in the pho ga, or thin-skinned chicken-leek dumplings whose filling is dominated by aromatics.848 Washington St. (at Ross Alley); (415) 296-8228.

103.0,Other,"Given Evan and Sarah Rich‚Äôs fine-dining pedigree ‚Äî the couple met while cooking together in New York and boast a San Francisco resume that includes Coi, Michael Mina and Quince ‚Äî no one would have batted an eye if they‚Äôd gone upscale when they busted out on their own six years ago. Instead, they opted to go casual.Since opening Rich Table, the couple have solidified their style. It‚Äôs an approach that resonates with diners. The Hayes Valley restaurant remains one of the hottest in the country, thanks to signature dishes like sardine-threaded potato chips, savory porcini doughnuts and aged duck lasagna with Santa Rosa plums.Over the years, the Riches have expanded their team, which now includes chef de cuisine Brandon Rice, and their empire, with the 2017 opening of the fast-casual RT Rotisserie a block from their flagship. Along with their versions of dishes like rotisserie chicken, their side-dish game is especially strong.Take this recipe from Rice, which flips a classic Caesar salad on its head by swapping out romaine (an especially good idea thanks to the ongoing contamination scares) for roasted Brussels sprouts and fish sauce for anchovies.Get saucy: Instead of the traditional anchovies, RT Rotisserie uses garum, a type of fermented fish sauce, to add those umami notes that make a Caesar-style salad so special. (You can substitute with Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce.)Emulsification station: To make your own aioli, mince 8 cloves of garlic with a pinch of kosher salt to form a paste. Scrape this paste into the bowl of a food processor. Add 2 large eggs and 4 teaspoons lemon juice and blend. Combine 1 cup of extra-virgin olive oil and 1 cup of canola or other light vegetable oil. With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the oils until they‚Äôre incorporated and the aioli is emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. You‚Äôll only need 1 cup of aioli for the Brussels sprouts, so save any leftovers for another use.Season as you go: From the cotija and Parmesan cheeses to the garum, there are a lot of salty elements going on in this dish, so taste as you add each element and adjust the salt to your preference.Frico factor:Opt out of chunky croutons by spreading the Parmesan cheese on a parchment-lined baking sheet and baking until crisp. This essentially creates a giant cheese chip, which when combined with toasted breadcrumbs ensures that you get flavorful crunchy bits with each bite.It‚Äôs a dish that, much like the couple‚Äôs two restaurants, combines savvy culinary know-how with a welcome dose of familiarity.Sarah Fritsche is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

128.0,Food,"When Pattar Dilmurat left Dubai, where he lived for five years selling fragrances and makeup, he told his wife he would be back in a year. So far, it has been two.Dilmurat, Akbar Amat and Aikelamu Ainiwaer own Sama Uyghur Cuisine in Union City, and are the only members of their families in the United States. Amat‚Äôs parents and younger sister are in China. Dilmurat‚Äôs 3-year-old son lives in Xinjiang Province with his father-in-law. His wife has remained in Dubai with their 5-year-old daughter, and the distance is starting to wear thin. Neither Dilmurat nor Amat have returned home since arriving.Life separated from their families is hard. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone here for the moment,‚Äù Dilmurat says. Far from family and the familiar, food has become a home away from home.Dilmurat, 34, came to the United States two years ago for school. He found a part-time job at a restaurant, working in the kitchen. His mother back in China heard the news. She was not happy. ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòWhy are you working in a restaurant? Do other jobs. It‚Äôs difficult,‚Äô‚Äù Dilmurat says.But he found comfort in making barbecue and hand-pulled noodles at Eden Silk Road in Fremont, which serves Uighur (sometimes spelled Uyghur) and Chinese halal food. It‚Äôs the food he grew up with. ‚ÄúAt least I can eat my own food,‚Äù he says.At work, he moved into management and met Akbar Amat, a 26-year-old chef who is also Uighur. Like Dilmurat, Amat had come from China to America to study. He lived first in Los Angeles, where he supported himself by cutting grass, then painting homes, and eventually working in restaurants.The Uighur community in the United States is small, and Amat soon received an invitation to move to Northern California to work at Eden Silk Road as a chef, even though he didn‚Äôt know how to cook. He had grown up in a restaurant, though, the son of a chef. His father had sold kebabs from a street cart for many years before opening a small eatery in Tianjin, east of Beijing, which grew into a 500-seat restaurant.Amat learned to cook on the job at Eden Silk Road and ruminated on his family‚Äôs food. How could he make food that tasted like his memories of home?Now Dilmurat and Amat, along with third partner Aikelamu Ainiwaer, have made a new home. In June 2017, they opened Sama Uyghur Cuisine in a nondescript strip mall in Union City. Named for a traditional Uighur folk dance, the restaurant is tastefully decorated with handsome Scandinavian-style chairs and colorful rugs on the walls. The restaurant is small, with just nine tables, but it is a proud declaration of who they are ‚Äî and, they hope, an introduction of their culture to others.‚ÄúPeople ask, ‚ÄòWhere are you from?‚Äô When I say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm from China,‚Äô they don‚Äôt believe me from how I look,‚Äù says Dilmurat, who has a closely cut beard and, when working at the restaurant, wears shirts with intricately patterned textiles on the collar and cuffs.‚ÄúI say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Uighur.‚Äô Nobody knows Uighur. They don‚Äôt know us.‚ÄùThe Uighurs are an ethnic minority from the Xinjiang autonomous region in northwest China. They are a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language. In recent years, they have made global headlines as violence has flared in the region in the form of clashes between separatist and government forces.Dilmurat describes Uighur food as a mix between Central Asian and Chinese cuisines. ‚ÄúI say it‚Äôs Chinese first because we use Chinese recipes, like the spices.‚Äù On the menu are their own versions of chow mein and spicy chicken, he points out. But Uighur dishes are also similar to the cuisines of Arab countries, he says. For example: they have kebabs. The difference, though, is that they marinate the meat in spices for six hours before putting them on skewers. (You can feast on a whole lamb kebab ‚Äî more than 25 pounds of meat ‚Äî for $338. Please order one day ahead.)The recipes come from Amat‚Äôs father, but it took some convincing to get him to share them. Like Dilmurat‚Äôs mother, Amat‚Äôs family objected to his opening a restaurant, he says in Mandarin. They said it would be too difficult.It certainly has been harder than the three owners anticipated. They ran into unexpected delays with the process: permits, taxes, signage, health inspections. Everything took longer and cost more than expected. Food costs, especially for halal meat, are high. During the first month, they sometimes  slept just two hours a night before coming back to work. ‚ÄúSometimes I wanted to cry,‚Äù Dilmurat says.It‚Äôs still tough now, he says, but getting better. They work 11- or 12-hour days at the restaurant six days a week.Amat, in a T-shirt and bowl haircut, speaks haltingly in English, which he is learning. He takes classes at Ohlone College in Fremont on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, he says. His classes end at 10:40 a.m, and the restaurant opens at 11 a.m. for lunch. Dilmurat was also taking college classes, but recently dropped them. He had no time to do his homework. Maybe it will take him 10 years to graduate, he says with a shrug.When asked if he does his homework, Amat just laughs.How fortunate it is to come to a country where you don‚Äôt know anybody and find people you can build something with together. Within an hour of meeting Ainiwaer, the third partner who is Uighur from Sweden, he agreed to open a restaurant with Dilmurat and Amat. They just trusted each other, Dilmurat says. When he met Amat, he felt the same. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some feeling. I can tell he is a nice guy. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs feeling the same way.‚ÄùSitting next to him, Amat doesn‚Äôt say anything, but he smiles. Melissa Hung is a freelance journalist in San Francisco. Email: food@sfchronicle.com.

75.0,Food,"Here are two statements I believe to be incontrovertibly true:Americans, who can catalog almost as many regional pizza styles as we can ‚ÄúReal Housewives,‚Äù will argue over the authenticity of a slice with as much ferocity as we do questions like ‚ÄúWhy are they still making ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô movies?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is really up with Kanye?‚ÄùNo one who specializes in an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù regional pizza style can resist the impulse to make it their own.The paradox of pizza authenticity is on display at Square Pie Guys, Marc Schechter and Danny Stoller‚Äôs 4-month-old pop-up, whose interpretation of Detroit-style pizza is both heretical and delicious, as well as in the new Detroit-style pizzas at Pizza Squared in the Design District and Leaning Tower in Oakland.All serve what first appear to be mini Sicilian pies ‚Äî which aren‚Äôt square, by the way, but rectangular ‚Äî until you lift one up and notice a filigree fence of crisped, brown cheese around the rim. Some dot the top of the pie with sauce instead of spreading it underneath the cheese cap. The most persnickety import brick cheese from the Midwest.Detroit-style pizza may not be having quite the same moment as culturally appropriative ayurvedic treatments and fuzzy sweaters, but it‚Äôs having a moment nonetheless. The story of how Schechter, 30, and Stoller, 29, started Square Pie Guys is far more roundabout than some epiphanic meal in Detroit. Neither has visited the city yet, in fact. They discovered their pizza polestar thanks to two Bay Area companies: Tony‚Äôs Pizza Napoletana and Instagram.The origins of Detroit-style pizza ‚Äî DSP when you‚Äôre talking to pizza obsessives ‚Äî do lie in Detroit, at least. According to an interview that Marie Guerra Easterby gave to Detroit radio station WOMC a few years back, Gus Guerra, her father, learned to make pizza from his Sicilian mother-in-law. In 1946, he introduced the pies to a Detroit bar named Buddy‚Äôs Rendezvous, baked in square-edge, blue steel auto-part trays he picked up at a local hardware store. In 1953, Guerra left Buddy‚Äôs and opened another pizzeria called Cloverleaf.Over the next 60-odd years, the two pizzerias expanded into local chains whose inch-thick slices, puffy and dimpled, had two hallmarks: a layer of brick cheese (brick is its official name, and it‚Äôs similar to jack) that melted onto the edges of the heavy pans, and tomato sauce spooned on top of the cheese.Now, no one sets out to invent a regional style of pizza. In fact, people who live in the region are often the last to recognize that this thing they‚Äôve been eating for years is unique to them. (As proof, I submit to you: When was the last time you referred to the pies from Gialina, Chez Panisse Cafe and Pizzahacker as ‚ÄúBay Area pizza‚Äù?)It took a Detroiter with his eye on international pizza competitions to bring DSP out of regional obscurity. In 2012, Shawn Randazzo, the owner of two Cloverleaf franchises, baked a square pie with chicken, bacon, sauteed garlic, onions and barbecue sauce (an ‚ÄúIron Chef‚Äù-esque twist) at the International Pizza Expo in Las Vegas. The pie made Randazzo the World Champion Pizza Maker of the Year and the envy of his pizza peers.One of these peers was Tony Gemignani, founder of Tony‚Äôs Pizza Napoletana in North Beach. That same year, Gemignani says, he and a few students in one of his classes at the International School of Pizza mulled over this revolutionary Detroit style. Several members of that class subsequently opened DSP shops in Colorado and Texas. Gemignani, too, traveled back to Detroit to do a little reconnaissance and secure a supply of steel pans. He introduced his own version at Tony‚Äôs Pizza Napoletana, his North Beach flagship, around 2013, and included a recipe in his 2014 book ‚ÄúThe Pizza Bible.‚Äù‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs comfort food. It has a lot of flavor,‚Äù Gemignani says of the style. ‚ÄúThe sauce on top of this pizza ‚Äî you even see #sauceontop hashtags ‚Äî makes your pizza pop more.‚ÄùHere is where I confess that I enjoyed the Tony‚Äôs Detroit pizza so much that I made a Buddy‚Äôs detour during a trip to Michigan a few years back. By comparison, Gemignani‚Äôs version came across as a stadium-rock interpretation of the original: note-perfect yet amplified. Some of the differences were due to the way Gemignani‚Äôs cooks leaven the dough and add cheddar to the brick cheese on the crust.I am not the kind of guy who shares his pizza tourism pics on Instagram, let alone uses #sauceontop. That would be Marc Schechter, a Long Island, N.Y.-born software salesman and stand-up comedian who broadcasts his love for pizza via his Instagram feed, @pizzaman_420.Schechter‚Äôs been posting photos of his home-baked pies for years now and direct-messaging with pizza stars to ask questions, finding them more approachable than he ever expected. Not long after moving to the Bay Area from Seattle, Schechter interned and then worked in his off-hours at restaurants like Pizzahacker and Pizzeria Delfina in Burlingame. (‚ÄúIt was really a trial by fire,‚Äù he says of Saturday shifts at the latter. ‚ÄúI have the burns from the pizza oven to prove it.‚Äù)In his other spare time, he practiced baking DSP at home, with an eye on taking it pro. Schechter says he didn‚Äôt want to open yet another shop selling crisp-crusted, naturally leavened, seasonally responsive Bay Area pizzas. ‚ÄúI love the flavor profile: This fluffy dough, the crispy bottom, the cheese (that) pushes out to the edge,‚Äù Schechter says. ‚ÄúIn your one bite of Detroit-style you get the texture experience of a whole pie.‚ÄùIn March 2018, after Pizzahacker owner Jeff Krupman dropped his long-running pizza pop-up nights at Vinyl, a wine bar on Divisadero, Schechter took over the deck ovens to bake New York and Neapolitan pizzas. Five months in, he roped in Danny Stoller, who had cooked for decades under Seattle‚Äôs best-known chefs and now works here for a culinary innovation company.They bought blue-steel pans from pizza champion Randazzo, who now has a second career supplying aspirational DSP makers like them. On Thursday and Friday nights, the Square Pie Guys now put out pies like the PeppeRoni-Burgundy and a Mean Green Sausage Machine with ricotta sauce, roasted broccolini and honey. Beyond their crackling rim and airy crumb, the pies don‚Äôt quite taste like Buddy‚Äôs or Tony‚Äôs DSP. They aren‚Äôt spotted with #sauceontop. They don‚Äôt use brick cheese. If we‚Äôre speaking frankly, Square Pie Guys‚Äô pizzas taste as if serious cooks brought the Pizza Hut pan pizza up to San Francisco standards.

You could, of course, substitute regular broccoli, or green beans. Make sure you have everything prepared before you begin to stir-fry: Start to finish, this goes from pan to table in under 10 minutes. Some steamed white rice is the only recommended accompaniment, but if you‚Äôve sworn off that for the time being, know that the stir-fry is perfectly satisfying on its own, or with brown rice or quinoa alongside.¬†¬†Jessica Battilana is a San Francisco freelance writer and the author of ‚ÄúRepertoire: All the Recipes You Need.‚Äù Twitter: @jbattilana Email: food@sfchronicle.com Recipe: Stir-Fried Shrimp and Chinese Broccoli in Black Bean Sauce  Serves 4 ¬æ pound gai lan (Chinese broccoli) or regular broccoli1 tablespoon fermented Chinese black beans1¬Ω tablespoons rice wine or dry Sherry1 tablespoon minced garlic1 tablespoon minced ginger¬Ω to 1 teaspoon red chile oil, or ¬º to ¬Ω teaspoon red pepper flakes6 green onions, three finely sliced into thin rings, three cut into 1-inch lengths¬Ω cup low-sodium chicken stock1 tablespoon soy sauce1 teaspoon cornstarch¬Ω teaspoon sugar1 pound raw medium shrimp, peeled and deveinedKosher salt2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oilSteamed rice, for servingInstructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

52.0,Food,"Two short years ago I asked why there weren‚Äôt more West Coast sparkling wine producers. Did I tempt fate? It now seems like practically everyone is getting into the sparkling game.After all, Americans are drinking more sparkling wine than ever before. Last year, sparkling wine sales in the U.S. grew by 25 percent, and sparkling ros√© by 20 percent, according to Nielsen data. Our palates seem increasingly interested in light and refreshing drinks; witness the popularity of ros√©, or of spritz cocktails (which often incorporate sparkling wine). In 2016, I named a cult California sparkling wine producer, Michael Cruse, the Chronicle Winemaker of the Year. Surely a few short years ago we could not have fathomed the phrase ‚Äúcult California sparkling wine producer.‚ÄùNow, in addition to the old California standbys ‚Äî the Schramsbergs and Iron Horses and Scharffenbergers ‚Äî there‚Äôs a smattering of new names, too. Some are following the age-old method of transplanting a Champagne-based company to California (Pommery), but in a new trend, several California wineries (Jordan, Boisset, Claypool, Vivier) are actually making Champagne in Champagne.Then there are California‚Äôs native newcomers. In addition to Under the Wire, Lichen Estate, Caraccioli and Cruse‚Äôs Ultramarine, a bunch of new wine labels are entirely devoted to bubbly (such as Loubud, Breathless, Flaunt), and established still-wine producers are now dabbling in the stuff (Presqu‚Äôile, Lucas & Lewellen, Alma Rosa, Fess Parker and too many more to name here).Beyond the wines modeled on Champagne, there are all sorts of sparkling wines made with unorthodox grapes or by unorthodox methods: sparkling Grenache (Rock Wall), charmat-method Sauvignon Blanc (Bodkin), plus p√©tillant-naturels of every hue imaginable from the likes of Scar of the Sea, Donkey & Goat, Halcyon, Birichino and Broc. Next year, Larkmead assistant winemaker Dan Person will be debuting his sparkling-focused Carboniste label with a traditional-method Albari√±o.(For visual proof of this proliferation, check out Liz Dodder‚Äôs maps of sparkling wine producers just in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties on her blog, Cali Coast Wine Country.)Given the bubbles-positive consumer market, I assumed that many of these new American sparkling wine labels would be the products of extensive R&D, born of calculated marketing strategies.I was very wrong.‚ÄúBubbly was a backup plan,‚Äù says Ryan Beauregard of Santa Cruz‚Äôs Beauregard Vineyards, who released his first sparkling wines earlier this year. ‚ÄúThe weather forced us into doing it.‚Äù2010 brought such a cold harvest season, Beauregard explains, that a section of grapes in Beauregard‚Äôs Bald Mountain Vineyard couldn‚Äôt get ripe. The result? Pinot Noir and Chardonnay far too acidic to make into still wine. Although he‚Äôd never made sparkling wine before, Beauregard figured he‚Äôd give it a shot.That nascent base wine spent five years en tirage ‚Äî resting in bottle with the dead yeast cells ‚Äî while Beauregard saved up to buy the equipment he‚Äôd need to finish the process. To fund the purchases of a riddling rack, a bottle neck freezer, a disgorgement agent and more, he offered the sparkling wines to his mailing list as futures.But equipment wasn‚Äôt Beauregard‚Äôs biggest hurdle. Knowledge was. When technical questions came up, he had no one to call for guidance. ‚ÄúYouTube became my teacher,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI watched a bunch of videos in French. Eventually it started to make sense.‚Äù Now Beauregard has released some wines from that first, serendipitous 2010 vintage ‚Äî but he‚Äôs keeping about 300 bottles en tirage until 2020, and plans to continue to keep a portion of each year‚Äôs inventory under extended lees aging.A different sort of accident led to the inaugural 2014 vintage of sparkling wine from Oregon‚Äôs Willamette Valley Vineyards.Back in 1983, the winery‚Äôs founder, Jim Bernau, planted an uncommon Chardonnay clone, called Espiguette 352, at his estate vineyard. Those Espiguette grapes ‚Äúalways made our least favorite Chardonnay,‚Äù says winery director Christine Clair. ‚ÄúIt was too acidic, never had much body to it, and the flavors never got beyond lemon or lime,‚Äù Clair says. ‚ÄúIt was just a neutral white wine.‚ÄùDecades later, it occurred to the team: What if instead of trying to make a Burgundy-style Chardonnay, they attempted a Champagne-style Chardonnay? ‚ÄúWe decided that we could dedicate these grapes to what they were meant to do,‚Äù Clair says.Willamette Valley Vineyards enlisted the help of local winemaker Andrew Davis, a protege of Rollin Soles at Oregon‚Äôs best-known sparkling winery, Argyle. To spread the bubbly gospel, Davis had recently launched Radiant Sparkling Wine Company to help small wineries make sparkling wine ‚Äî imagining an Oregonian version of the grower-producer Champagne movement. With Davis‚Äô guidance, Willamette Valley Vineyards can make its brut mostly in its own winery, sending the bottles out to the Radiant facility only for riddling and disgorgement.‚ÄúWe really believe sparkling is something Oregon can be known for,‚Äù Clair says, pointing out that its climate and varietals ‚Äî Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, two of Champagne‚Äôs major grapes ‚Äî ‚Äúare a perfect fit.‚ÄùProduction volume has expanded each year, reaching about 2,000 cases in the 2017 vintage. Willamette Valley Vineyards has even purchased a new vineyard in the Dundee Hills area that will grow grapes for sparkling wine exclusively. They‚Äôve planted some more Espiguette 352 Chardonnay there, which will come into production in time for next year‚Äôs vintage.Careful planning or happy accident ‚Äî who‚Äôs keeping track?"

93.0,Food,"Your typical California winemaker would be in despair if her efforts had resulted in the kind of wine that Mandy Heldt Donovan just made. But Donovan did it on purpose.Donovan inoculated a wine with brettanomyces, a spoilage yeast that most winemakers here spend their careers desperately trying to avoid. Brettanomyces ‚Äî or brett, to winemakers ‚Äî can live in winery environments and can imbue wines, if it gets into them, with a spectrum of off-putting flavors: manure, Band-Aid, horse sweat.Challenge accepted. ‚ÄúI was just curious,‚Äù says Donovan, whose wine label is called Merisi. ‚ÄúIs this a tool we could use?‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a sacrilegious notion in some circles, especially Napa Valley, where Donovan lives. Here, brett is regarded as an uncontrollable agent of destruction. Often called the ‚Äújunkyard dog‚Äù of wine yeasts, brett will feast on anything from sugars to acids, making it not just unpleasant to taste but also prone to proliferation, capable of overpowering all of a wine‚Äôs native fruity flavors with that smear of manure.‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs scared of brett,‚Äù says Donovan. The prevailing wisdom, she believes: ‚ÄúThis is why you don‚Äôt have a gorilla as a pet. It‚Äôs a wild animal. You can‚Äôt tame it.‚ÄùBut if brett is so unpalatable, Donovan wondered, how to explain its popularity in craft beer? Brewers like Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River Brewing Co. and Tomme Arthur of Lost Abbey have been making bretty beers on purpose since the late nineties ‚Äî sometimes even letting brett perform the primary fermentation, leaving out the typical beer and wine yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, altogether.In recent years the bretty beer category has exploded, with local breweries like Southpaw, Pedro Point, Almanac, Sante Adairius and the Rare Barrel getting in on the action. And craft beer drinkers, including Donovan herself, seem to love it. Could she make a wine that appealed to sour beer lovers?So in 2017, Donovan siphoned off a little bit of Carneros Pinot Gris she‚Äôd made, took it to her home basement ‚Äî she was careful to keep this experiment separate from the winery where she makes her normal wines, which taste clean and not at all funky ‚Äî and inoculated it with a strain of brett she had purchased from a craft beer supplier.‚ÄúI chose a fruity strain of brett,‚Äù she adds, one that the yeast supplier promised would not taste like Band-Aid. (Brett has many hues, as we‚Äôll learn later.) In that first year, Donovan made just 30 cases; in 2018, she made 50.The resulting wine, called the Merisi Manic White, has something in common with a saison beer: It smells fruity, gingery, bright. The barnyard character, brett‚Äôs hallmark, appears most strongly on the finish, but before you get there you taste soy, green herbs, some smokiness. Donovan left a little bit of residual sugar to balance the wine‚Äôs sourness. It is strange, undoubtedly an acquired taste, and you may be more likely to enjoy it if you stop thinking about it as a Pinot Gris.Sounds a little like natural wine, right? It‚Äôs true that natural wine fanatics, who tend not to mind when wines aren‚Äôt squeaky-clean and flawless, might be the most receptive audience to the Manic White‚Äôs funky characteristics. Yet the Manic White is far from a natural wine, not least because it relies on commercial yeast rather than ambient strains.In fact, if part of natural wine‚Äôs imperative is relinquishing control over the winemaking process, Donovan is doing the opposite: attempting to harness the unharnessable.The Manic White is a science experiment ‚Äî one that engages with a crucial question posed by our current culinary moment. Is learning to love a bretty wine much different from learning to love kombucha or sauerkraut ‚Äî or, for that matter, for foreigners learning to love Chinese stinky tofu or French washed-rind cheese?Could an aversion to brett be more nurture than nature?To be clear: Brett has always had a fan club. For centuries, before the modern era ushered in antiseptic hygiene regimens, European wine cellars and breweries teemed with brett (many still do), and the yeast was considered an integral part of the beverages made there. That je ne sais quoi in old vintages of Mourvedre of Domaine Tempier, or Chateauneuf du Pape of Chateau Beaucastel; the Flanders red ale of Rodenbach or the lambic of Cantillon ‚Äî yep, that‚Äôs brett.Donovan became fascinated with brett during graduate school at UC Davis, while working in the lab of Dr. Linda Bisson, a yeast microbiologist. There, she got a crash course in wine sensory analysis, and began to see brett as a multifaceted, even potentially beautiful, component of wine.‚ÄúHow you process smells is totally tied to the emotion center,‚Äù Bisson explains. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre calling the putrid character, which can take on a rotten, almost vomit-like flavor ‚Äî for a lot of people, that just tastes like cheese.‚Äù It all depends on whether your brain links that taste sensation to a positive memory.If you accept that premise, the idea that any aroma or flavor is intrinsically ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù feels as wrong as assigning a value judgment to, say, a color.In 2013, Bisson created the ‚Äúbrettanomyces aroma wheel,‚Äù a diagram that categorizes the different sensory qualities that 83 different brett strains can express. They range from the familiar barnyard and horse sweat to burnt beans and sour milk, and even to pleasant aromas like lilac, maple syrup and tamarind.Donovan‚Äôs education in brett continued ‚Äî and intensified ‚Äî after graduate school, when she went to work at Cain, a Napa Valley estate where brett occasionally makes its way into the wines.‚ÄúMost people are too afraid to experiment with brett in a winery,‚Äù Donovan says. But as she stuck around with Cain winemaker Chris Howell, she saw that brett didn‚Äôt make the Cain wines taste like manure or Band-Aid. Instead, the yeast contributed floral, earthy characteristics that she liked.Howell is probably California wine‚Äôs most masterful brett whisperer, but even after 30 years at Cain he still doesn‚Äôt understand how the yeast works. ‚ÄúEverybody thinks that once your cellar‚Äôs infected with brett, everything goes,‚Äù Howell says. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs just not true.‚Äù Wine from certain Cain vineyard sections tends to go through a brett fermentation more often than others, suggesting that the winery building itself isn‚Äôt the only vector.Could it be that brett is just as much of an attribute of Cain‚Äôs unique vineyard sites as their soil type and elevation? ‚ÄúIs the microflora part of the terroir?‚Äù Howell asks.Donovan‚Äôs work in the Cain lab was crucial to deepening the winery‚Äôs understanding of brett‚Äôs mysterious ways, Howell says, especially her discovery of patterns in the timing of brett fermentations, which were picking up after wines had already been in barrel for almost a year.‚ÄúMandy really helped us look at brett as an organism, not a malady,‚Äù says Howell. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know everything about brett, but I know that if it were gone I‚Äôd miss it. We want to know how to work with it, not kill it.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs precisely what Donovan has been devoting herself to ever since ‚Äî while, of course, also making plenty of non-bretty wines. (For the record, the rest of the Merisi wines are made with little manipulation, starting with a native-yeast fermentation.)She sees a potential audience for Manic White in aficionados of sour beer, who may have more positive emotional responses to the flavors and aromas of brett than longtime wine drinkers. When pouring Manic White at a wine festival recently, Donovan says, ‚Äúpeople kept coming up to my table saying, ‚ÄòI heard you had the sour wine!‚Äô‚ÄùSo is learning to like brett a matter of retraining our palates, or simply opening our minds?I‚Äôve never minded a small amount of brett in a wine ‚Äî Cain, for instance, has long produced some of my favorite Cabernets in Napa ‚Äî but I admit that I find a total brett takeover in a wine or a beer hard to swallow, literally. When that sour funk overpowers everything else, I miss the taste of fruit. Then again, I spent years training my palate to identify brett as a flaw. If I were drinking a bretty beverage with a naive and open mind, would my brain pick out the lilac and maple syrup notes in brett, rather than the Band-Aid and manure?‚ÄúThe strength of the wine industry is tradition, but it‚Äôs also the weakness,‚Äù Donovan continues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very reticent to change.‚Äù As recently as the 1980s, she points out, California wineries were reluctant to embrace malolactic fermentation in white wines, now a standard practice. What other tools are we rejecting prematurely?Ultimately, though, what drives Donovan to work with brett is not the intellectual exercise. She just thinks that brett, if we can understand it and to some degree control it, can be beautiful. ‚ÄúI know not everyone agrees,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut I just don‚Äôt think the flavor of brett is that out of reach.‚Äù¬†"

It also helps to dry out the chicken‚Äôs skin, which will in turn promote better browning and crispness during the roasting process.Breaking bread: Chopping, then tearing the bread into large, irregular chunks will give the dressing and drippings from the chicken plenty of nooks and crannies to adhere to and make for a more flavorful salad. The bread salad can be made up to several hours prior to serving.Temp work: Wondering if the chicken is done? Make sure your thermometer is calibrated. For non-digital instant-read thermometers, you can do this by submerging the stem of the thermometer in a glass of ice water and letting it sit for a couple of minutes.

Pat dry inside and out. Slide a finger under the skin on each side of the breast, making a pocket in each. Use a fingertip to gently loosen a pocket of skin over the thickest section of each thigh. Shove 1 thyme sprig into each pocket. Season with the salt and pepper, sprinkling a little bit of salt inside the cavity. Tuck the wing tips behind the shoulders. Cover loosely and refrigerate from 2 days for a smaller chicken to 3 days for a 3¬Ω-pound chicken.To prepare the bread salad: Preheat the broiler. Cut the bread into 2 large chunks. Carve off the bottom crust and most of the top and side crust, leaving some on for texture. Brush with the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Broil briefly, to crisp and lightly color the surface on both sides. Trim off any charred tips. Tear chunks into a combination of irregular 2- to 3-inch wads, bite-size bits and fat crumbs. You should get about 4 cups.Combine ¬º cup olive oil with the Champagne vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Toss ¬º cup of this vinaigrette with the bread in a wide bowl. Adjust for seasoning with salt and pepper and toss again.Put the currants in a bowl with the vinegar and 1 tablespoon warm water. Set aside.To roast the chicken: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Heat a shallow, flameproof roasting pan, barely larger than the chicken, or an oven-proof 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Wipe the chicken dry and place, breast-side up, in the pan. It should sizzle.Place the pan in the center of the oven. Listen and watch for it to start sizzling and browning within 20 minutes. If it hasn‚Äôt, increase the temperature progressively until it does. If the chicken begins to char, or the fat is smoking aggressively, reduce temperature by 25 degrees. After 30 minutes, turn the bird over and roast 10 to 20 minutes. Turn bird again to re-crisp breast skin, another 5 to 10 minutes. Total roasting time will be 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the internal temperature is 165 degrees.Meanwhile: Put the pine nuts in a baking dish; set in oven just to warm through, then add to the bread. Put 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet, and add the garlic and green onions. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until softened. Don‚Äôt let them color. Scrape the mixture into the bread and fold to combine.Drain the currants; fold them into the salad. Drizzle the chicken stock over the salad; fold again. Taste and adjust with salt, pepper or a few drops of vinegar, then toss well.Pile the bread salad into a 1-quart baking dish. Tent with foil and place in the oven after you flip the chicken the final time. Set the salad bowl aside.To finish and serve: When you remove the chicken from the oven, turn off the oven, but leave in the salad for another 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Pour off and discard the clear fat from the roasting pan, leaving the lean drippings behind. Add 1 tablespoon water to the pan and swirl it. Slash the skin between the chicken thighs and breast, then tilt the bird and plate over the roasting pan to drain the juices into the drippings. Set the chicken in a warm spot and set a platter in the oven to warm for a minute or two.Tilt the roasting pan and skim off the last bit of fat. Put the pan over medium-low heat. Add any juices that have collected around the chicken and bring to a simmer. Stir and scrape to dissolve drippings.Return the salad to the salad bowl. Drizzle a spoonful of pan juices over the bread and toss. Add the greens and a final drizzle of the remaining vinaigrette; fold to combine. Toss again."
7.0,Biz+Tech,"NEW YORK ‚Äî Amazon abruptly dropped plans Thursday for a big new headquarters in New York that would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city, reversing course after politicians and activists objected to the nearly $3 billion in tax breaks promised to what is already one of the world‚Äôs richest, most powerful companies.‚ÄúWe are disappointed to have reached this conclusion ‚Äî we love New York,‚Äù the online giant from Seattle said in a blog post announcing its withdrawal.In pulling out of New York, Amazon said it isn‚Äôt looking for a replacement location ‚Äúat this time.‚Äù It said it plans to spread the technology jobs set for New York to other offices around the U.S. and Canada, including Chicago, Toronto and Austin, Texas. It will also expand its existing New York offices, which already have about 5,000 employees.The stunning move was a serious blow to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had lobbied intensely to land the project, competing against more than 200 other metropolitan areas across the continent that were practically tripping over each other to offer incentives to Amazon in a fierce bidding war the company stoked.Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City‚Äôs new liberal firebrand, exulted over Amazon‚Äôs pullout.‚ÄúToday was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon‚Äôs corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world,‚Äù she tweeted, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.The swift unraveling of the project reflected growing antipathy toward large companies among liberals and populists who accuse big business of holding down wages and wielding too much political clout, analysts said.‚ÄúThis all of a sudden became a perfect test case for all those arguments,‚Äù said Joe Parilla, a fellow at the Brooking Institution‚Äôs Metropolitan Policy Project.Amazon ultimately decided it did not want to be drawn into that battle.Amazon announced in November that it had chosen the Long Island City section of Queens for one of two new headquarters, with the other in Arlington, Va. Both would get 25,000 jobs. A third site in Nashville would get 5,000.The company had planned to spend $2.5 billion building the New York office, choosing the area in part because of its large pool of tech talent.The governor and the mayor had argued that Amazon would transform the neighborhood into a high-tech hub and spur economic growth that would pay for the $2.8 billion in state and city incentives many times over.After Amazon‚Äôs change of heart, Cuomo complained that ‚Äúa small group of politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community.‚Äù And the mayor criticized Amazon for not doing more to try to win over New Yorkers.‚ÄúYou have to be tough to make it in New York City,‚Äù de Blasio said.Amazon faced fierce opposition over the tax breaks, with critics complaining that the project was an extravagant giveaway ‚Äî or worse, a shakedown ‚Äî and that it wouldn‚Äôt provide much direct benefit to most New Yorkers.The list of grievances against the project grew as the months wore on, with critics complaining about Amazon‚Äôs stance on unions and some Long Island City residents fretting that the company‚Äôs arrival would drive up rents and other costs.Opposition to the deal was led in the Democrat-controlled state Senate by Michael Gianaris, the chamber‚Äôs No. 2 lawmaker, whose district includes Long Island City. Initially among the politicians who supported bringing an Amazon headquarters to the city, Gianaris did an about-face after the deal was announced, criticizing the secrecy surrounding the negotiations and the generous incentives.A Quinnipiac University poll released in December found New York City voters supported having an Amazon headquarters by 57 to 26 percent. But they were divided over the incentives: 46 percent in favor, 44 percent against.In recent weeks, a City Council leader whose district includes Long Island City tried to get Amazon officials to agree to remain neutral in the face of any potential union drive. But an Amazon executive would not give such a commitment."

It was an apparent reference to an announcement about the defeat of the extremists in Syria.President Donald Trump said the White House will make an announcement about Syria and the fight against IS by the end of Saturday.""We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate and that will be announced over the next 24 hours,"" Trump told journalists at the White House on Friday.Furat's comments were carried by Kurdish news agencies, including Hawar News.Furat said IS fighters are besieged in an area that is about 700 square meters (840 square yards) adding that the push is slow because the extremists are using civilians as human shields. He added that SDF fighters were able to liberate 10 of the fighters that were held by IS.Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said SDF fighters are almost in full control of the area once controlled by extremists adding that there might still be IS fighters hiding in a network of underground tunnels.""The defeat of Daesh will not last days,"" Furat said, using an Arabic acronym to refer to the group. He added that after the physical defeat of IS, the SDF ""will continue in its fight against Daesh sleepers cells."""
120.0,Food,"Almost 17 years ago, on a very wet monsoon day in Bombay, I sat with my mom and packed my bags to leave for America. A few months before, I had accepted an offer to attend school in Cincinnati. Here I was, about to leave home for the first time. My excitement was palpable. I was curious about the unknown and enthusiastic about  a journey of a lifetime.Based on extensive consultations with family  and friends who lived in America, I had prepared a long list of things I needed to bring. The list contained  basic necessities, but also some things  I felt I could easily do without: a pressure cooker.At the time, I was terrified of pressure cookers. Due to their efficiency ‚Äî and their ability to be wonderfully applicable to most recipes in Indian cooking ‚Äî pressure cookers had become a popular kitchen appliance, even a staple, in most homes in India.Despite these advantages, my fear of pressure cookers stayed firm. I can vividly remember the deafening boom from my parents‚Äô kitchen. Somehow, the lid had flown off like a shuttle launching into deep space. The walls were splattered as if Jackson Pollock himself had come to give the kitchen an artful makeover. We were lucky that no one was in the kitchen, and the ceiling only had a small dent. Yet this one experience set the stage for my aversion to all stove-top pressure cookers.And now, my family had packed me off with one. I was not having it. Within a week of arriving on campus, I unloaded the cooker (that I had lugged all the way from India) on a classmate. For more than a decade, I happily avoided stove-top pressure cookers, and my parents were surprised that I managed to cook Indian food without one.As luck would have it, I then received a pressure cooker one Christmas.This pressure cooker was very different from the ones I knew growing up. For one, it was electric. It also carried a switch to safely release the steam from the nozzle. It took me a month to muster a bit of courage to use. And even then, I used it  in our backyard, just in case the lid flew off.I tried a recipe for dal. The entire process was uneventful ‚Äî every time the pressure built up, the cooker would gently release the steam. It wasn‚Äôt loud and it wasn‚Äôt terrifying; the lid stayed on and my dal cooked perfectly and quickly. After a few more recipes in the cooker, I eventually started to cook with it indoors.And what about the dal that I first cooked in the cooker? It was none other than dal makhani, a stew made by cooking urad beans with a few seasonings and then stirring in a bit of cream and yogurt to make it thick and creamy. This is also a dish you might come across on menus at Indian restaurants, but it‚Äôs quite simple to prepare and requires minimal effort.¬†Nik Sharma‚Äôs first solo cookbook is ‚ÄúSeason‚Äù (Chronicle Books).

Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.Serve hot with plain rice or bread (preferably flatbread such as roti) and plain yogurt."
12.0,Other,"Jobs in California‚Äôs once-steadily growing solar power sector fell for the second straight year in 2018, part of a nationwide decline amid uncertainty caused by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and challenges at the state level.While the state remains the largest source of solar industry employment, jobs fell 11 percent last year to 76,838 workers, according to the annual survey released Tuesday by the nonprofit Solar Foundation. Nationwide, solar jobs fell 3.2 percent to 242,343 workers, the report found.The foundation pinned the national solar jobs decline largely on an effort from certain U.S. manufacturers to get the federal government to place tariffs on imported solar modules and cells. The Trump administration imposed the tariffs last January, but uncertainty around the measure‚Äôs outcome led to a delay in solar projects, particularly for large utility-scale developments that have longer timelines, the report said.State-level factors were also a key reason for the decline, the Solar Foundation determined. In California, those included utilities facing less pressure to meet renewable energy portfolio standards because they‚Äôve already made substantial progress and policy uncertainties about rate structures for installers in the non-residential market, according to the report.Experts still see opportunities on the horizon, including California‚Äôs rooftop solar mandate for most new homes, which takes effect in 2020, and the state‚Äôs commitment to get 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045. A Green New Deal, if passed by Congress, would also help, said Solar Foundation executive director Andrea Luecke.‚ÄúClimate change is the headline and jobs is part of the common denominator,‚Äù Luecke said. ‚ÄúWe see a very bright future, and I think that the Green New Deal, along with all of the 100 percent renewable commitments that states and cities are making, is a very, very positive indicator as to where we‚Äôre headed ‚Äî and where we need to be headed very quickly.‚ÄùThe latest solar jobs survey was conducted between September and October and was administered to nearly 14,000 firms, of which nearly 3,500 provided some amount of information and about 2,700 provided full or substantial information, the foundation said. The sampling process has a margin of error of 1.45 percent.The report found that about two-thirds of the total solar jobs are in installation and project development, of which 56 percent are focused specifically on the residential market.‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing on the ground, especially in California, is that there is still strong demand,‚Äù said Alex McDonough, vice president of public policy at San Francisco‚Äôs Sunrun. ‚ÄúAs long as we continue having consistent, stable policy, the outlook remains very good.‚ÄùBernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association, said state policy changes to net energy metering ‚Äî how costumers that generate their own energy and feed it back to the grid are credited ‚Äî and rate structures made the economics of rooftop solar installations more difficult.‚ÄúThe whole market is driven by consumers being able to save money,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you change the economics ‚Äî like the payback period of ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to invest in these solar panels and it‚Äôs going to save me money in five years‚Äô ‚Äî if you change that calculation, you‚Äôre going to have a direct impact on sales.‚ÄùDel Chiaro said the rooftop solar mandate will help, but she expects the full impact will not be felt immediately. And while California‚Äôs aggressive renewable energy goal is also a positive for solar, state leaders need to do more to actually promote more contracts being signed, she said.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs reason to continue to be optimistic, but we‚Äôve just had a rough two years,‚Äù Del Chiaro said, pointing out ‚Äúthe irony of the rough state-level market on the ground ... while there‚Äôs a lot of excitement about goals on paper.‚ÄùDel Chiaro said solar advocates will continue to promote solar energy storage, which is one area that‚Äôs already a bright spot for Sunrun in particular. About 25 percent of the solar company‚Äôs new installations in California now include a battery, which will help customers manage their energy use as the state is shifting to charging rates based on demand during the time of day, McDonough said.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs transforming the residential solar industry,‚Äù he said of battery installations."
114.0,Food,"There‚Äôs nothing quite as beautiful as a warm, plump dumpling.Whether they‚Äôre the grab-and-go variety from a mom-and-pop dim sum shop loaded into a takeaway clamshell to be lugged home and devoured, or these vividly hued pot stickers from chef Brandon Jew, dumplings are a universal pleasure.At his Chinatown restaurant, Mister Jiu‚Äôs, Jew and his crew dye the dough with natural food colorings like beets, squid ink, carrots and purple cabbage to achieve dramatic jewel-like tones. It‚Äôs one of many dishes that exemplify how Jew has masterfully bridged classic Cantonese cooking and contemporary California cuisine.When the San Francisco native took over the Four Seas banquet hall in 2016, it was hailed as one of the most ambitious restaurants to open in decades. Accolades were swift and buzz was abundant, recalling the neighborhood‚Äôs culinary heyday when grand restaurants like Johnny Kan‚Äôs and the Empress of China were a hot ticket with celebrities and socialites.To produce enough dumplings to feed hungry diners night in and night out, Jew and his team roll out the dough into thin sheets using a pasta roller, and then cut it into rounds for filling. To keep things simple for a much smaller batch for home cooks, we‚Äôve adapted Jew‚Äôs recipe by sticking to a hand-rolled method.Rather than pork, Jew‚Äôs pot stickers are filled with ground chicken, ginger and Swiss chard ‚Äî both leaves and finely diced stems, which provide fresh, pleasantly bitter notes, as well as texture. For a bit of heat, Jew relies on a heady hit of ground white pepper.Dumplings symbolize wealth and prosperity, so these are especially appropriate for the Lunar New Year ‚Äî and the red-tinted wrappers, which represent good fortune, make them particularly festive.¬†Sarah Fritsche is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Scoop about a tablespoon of filling and position it slightly off-center toward the upper half of the wrapper, pressing and shaping it into a flat mound and keeping about ¬Ω- to ¬æ-inch of wrapper clear on all sides.Fold the wrapper so the edges meet and use your thumb and index finger to press the edges to seal. Holding the ends, put the dumpling straight-side down on your work surface and gently push down to make it sit flat.If you  get frustrated, remember that even if they don‚Äôt have the prettiest folds, the pot stickers will still taste good.Best of both worlds: Cooking the pot stickers in a hot, nonstick skillet is key. First, brown them in oil, then add a healthy splash of water and cover to allow the dumplings to gently steam before you give them a final chance to brown after the water evaporates. This technique allows the dumpling filling to cook  while creating a deliciously crusty pan-fried bottom.Fresh and tangy: Black vinegar and young ginger ‚Äî which has a thin papery skin, is less tough and fibrous and has a more delicate flavor than mature ginger ‚Äî cut the richness and offer a tangy counterpoint to the earthy dumplings. You can find both at Asian markets. (If you can‚Äôt find young ginger, mature will also work.)2 tablespoons vegetable oilBlack vinegarPeeled and julienned young gingerFor the filling: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Separate the Swiss chard leaves from the stems. Finely dice enough of the stems to make about ¬º cup. Set aside. Blanch the leaves until tender, about 2 minutes. Blot with paper towels to remove excess moisture and chop.In a large mixing bowl, combine the chard leaves and stems with the remaining filling ingredients. Set aside.For the wrappers: In a medium saucepan, bring the beet juice to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and skim off any foam.Place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and slowly add the hot beet juice, mixing with a wooden spoon just until dough begins to form.Lightly flour your work surface, turn out dough and knead until smooth, about 7 minutes. (If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour as you knead.) Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.Lightly dust your work surface with cornstarch and shape dough into 2 logs, each about 1 foot long. Cut dough into 1-inch rounds. Keeping dough loosely covered with plastic wrap as you work, flatten each piece of dough with your hand. Dust a rolling pin with cornstarch and roll out dough so you have thin circles about 3 inches in diameter.To finish and serve: Line a couple of baking sheets with parchment.Place a small mound of filling in the center of each circle and seal by pleating the top edge to form a half-moon shape. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. As you work, place the filled pot stickers on the prepared baking sheets and loosely cover with plastic wrap. (At this point, the pot stickers can be made ahead and frozen for up to 1 month.)Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Arrange the pot stickers in the pan in a single layer, pleated side up. Fry the pot stickers until they are golden brown on the bottom, about 1¬Ω to 2 minutes.Carefully pour ¬º cup water into the pan (it may splatter when the water hits the oil) and immediately cover. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the water has mostly evaporated, about 4 minutes. Uncover and let the pot stickers cook another minute or 2 to let the bottoms brown and crisp up a bit more."
158.0,Food,"Ayala, the new seafood-focused restaurant and bar in Union Square‚Äôs Hotel G, checks all the boxes of current San Francisco chic.Like Pearl 6101 in the Richmond District, the corner space is clad in white, with dark accents and vintage-glam light fixtures suspended from the ceiling like oversize jewelry. Like at the Beehive in the Mission, there‚Äôs a curtained-off nook that hints at discreet romantic encounters (though I‚Äôd wager it‚Äôs more likely to be booked for birthday dinners or corporate recruiting).At Ayala, like at Violet‚Äôs, you can share a chilled seafood platter or a cheeky avocado-studded riff on the Louie salad; like at Theorita (we hardly knew ye), there‚Äôs a dinnertime English muffin that shouldn‚Äôt be skipped. Like at Angler, you can dine on a whole petrale sole and wrap up the evening with your choice of unfamiliar amari. And like Tartine Manufactory, Ayala has a cocktail program designed by Julian Cox, a four-time James Beard nominee.You could worry that our hot spots are beginning to blur together, one briny martini and custom-tile installation after another ‚Äî that we‚Äôre living in a big shared Pinterest board in the cloud.But the other night, when I brought some out-of-town relatives to dinner at Ayala, I felt glad to show it off, to share with them a sampler of what‚Äôs happening in San Francisco, all without leaving Union Square.Ayala‚Äôs cocktail list, like many around town, name-checks a dozen ingredients my in-laws didn‚Äôt recognize, which might signify hipness but also takes advantage of all the good stuff that‚Äôs available these days ‚Äî assorted aperitivi, vermouths and, yes, Marilyn Manson‚Äôs own brand of absinthe. However the drinks read, plenty of Cox‚Äôs creations are easy-sipping and beginner-friendly. He often uses more pungent ingredients softly, as a chef uses seasoning.The Diving Bell ($14), for example, is refreshing and tart, a sort of souped-up margarita that‚Äôs fragrant with yuzu, soothed with pineapple syrup and almond-and-clove-laced Falernum. The drink gets the subtlest savory edge from a split base of gin and mezcal (plus a sprinkle of chile), but you don‚Äôt have to be a mezcal aficionado to like it.Ayala‚Äôs bar highlights the diversity of fortified wines that have made their way into the market in recent years, a common move among local bars now. And Cox does it well, showcasing Calistoga-produced Massican vermouth in the refreshing Vermouth Julep ($12), sloshed with Meletti anisette. He boosts the anise note by mixing in a fennel tea syrup and spraying the top of the drink‚Äôs crushed ice and mint garnish with tarragon oil. (Yes, it‚Äôs confusing to sniff at mint and smell tarragon instead, but it works.)Even the more brooding, boozy cocktails are pretty light on their feet ‚Äî they‚Äôre drinks you can savor alongside a seafood dinner, but they‚Äôre delicious enough to merit a special stop. Inspired by Bar Agricole‚Äôs long-running gin-based old-fashioned, Cox cleverly adapts the Sazerac ($14), a boozy New Orleans classic, to feature a malty blend of two genevers and two gins (including the rye-based gin from St. George Spirits used at Bar Agricole). In addition to the traditional absinthe rinse, a little mezcal shores up the drink, making for an extremely aromatic cocktail that tastes brightly of grain and cooling herbs but still feels a little like drinking whiskey.I like a Rob Roy (that is, a scotch manhattan) as much as any sensible heavy drinker. Still, ordering the Notorious ‚Äî at $18, one of the more expensive cocktails I‚Äôve seen around San Francisco lately ‚Äî hurts a bit. Cox mixes easygoing Paddy‚Äôs Irish whiskey with sturdier, toastier Powers John Lane, a single pot-stilled Irish whiskey that‚Äôs aged at least 12 years and sells for around $72 a bottle. Instead of vermouth, Cox stirs in two flavorful, bitter aperitivi (Cardamaro and Bonal), then sprays the cocktail with Longrow 18 Year Campbeltown Single Malt Scotch (a bottling that would cost you $179.99 at K&L, but at this point who‚Äôs counting?). The combination is velvety and peaty, filigreed with Christmas spice. It‚Äôs an $18 argument that high-end whisk(e)y can shine in a mixed drink, and I have to admit it‚Äôs a pretty convincing one.As I offered sips to my tablemates, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of jealousy toward the lone traveler sitting at Ayala‚Äôs bar. He didn‚Äôt have to share his plate of nori spaghettini ($29), a deeply savory tangle of springy noodles topped with Dungeness crab and dressed in miso. Over the course of three visits, it was my favorite dish by far from the kitchen, which is headed up by chef-partner Bill Montagne and executive chef Melissa Perfit (a ‚ÄúTop Chef‚Äù season 15 contestant who was previously the executive chef at Bar Crudo). Add a warm, tender English muffin, too, if only as a vehicle for the quenelle of herb-flecked butter that‚Äôs served alongside it, and you‚Äôve got a pretty delightful break from whatever low-carb diet you swore you‚Äôd follow around the end of the holidays.Union Square was long considered a wasteland of department-store shopping and bland high-rise hotels, and it can feel a little grim now that its Christmas lights are gone. But its cocktail scene has taken a dramatic turn in recent years. My advice is: Don‚Äôt leave.Pacific Cocktail Haven is just two blocks up from Ayala, and Rye only three blocks away. The bar at Gibson, which is by turns bizarre and delightful, is a four-minute walk down Mason. But perhaps my favorite part of going to Ayala is that you can have a really special ‚Äî and really San Francisco ‚Äî evening without even exiting the building.That‚Äôs because the Hotel G‚Äôs second floor houses Benjamin Cooper, a cozy den of a bar where local couples sit in candlelit corners, laughing over quirky, multilayered cocktails with funny names. As the night ticks on, the music grows a little more boisterous upstairs. Restaurant workers and bartenders swing by for shots on their way home. One nightcap may lead to another.

Many hosts claimed ignorance of the registration rule. Others said it was too cumbersome. Others chose to defy it.San Francisco worked closely with Airbnb on a pioneering vacation-rental law requiring all local hosts to register starting in February 2015. The city wanted to make sure that only permanent residents rent to tourists, so landlords don‚Äôt turn vacant apartments into lucrative ad hoc hotels. By getting hosts to register, it can verify that they are permanent residents and require them to report on how often they rent to tourists.But only a fraction of hosts registered. That left the city playing cat-and-mouse games to track down illegal operators.In frustration, San Francisco supervisors got tough. They passed a law to levy steep fines and criminal penalties on websites that brokered rentals in unregistered units. Airbnb and HomeAway sued ‚Äî and essentially lost. A judge ordered them to work with the city on a registration system. Their agreement included a phase-in to jettison unregistered hosts over the months from September until Jan. 16."
86.0,Other,"When I first moved to San Francisco, bright-eyed and eager, I used to pester local friends about where I could find certain kinds of cuisine. Is there any really great Indian food (besides Shalimar)? What‚Äôs Afghan food like? Can you get it in S.F.?The responses were often variations on the same answer: ‚ÄúThere are a few places, but the good stuff is in Fremont.‚ÄùFremont. Always Fremont. And yet, in the 17 years I‚Äôve lived in the Bay Area, I think I‚Äôve been there four times, including twice this month. Having promised in an earlier installment of this column that I‚Äôd be giving the greater Bay Area its proper due, I figure I should begin to make good on my word.One of the people who has frequently sung Fremont‚Äôs praises is my friend Joe, an Afghan American lawyer who now lives in New York but still has family in the Bay Area. I asked him to connect me to any local relatives who might know what‚Äôs good in Fremont, and within a few minutes, he texted me a list of six places that his cousins had enthusiastically recommended for Afghan food in San Carlos, Oakland, Pleasanton and Fremont. They made a point of singling out De Afghanan in Fremont as their favorite.There‚Äôs actually a branch of De Afghanan right here in San Francisco. On the Afghan tip, there‚Äôs also Helmand Palace on Van Ness, which serves a similar array of dishes in a more upmarket setting. If you live in the city and you‚Äôve never tried mantoo (slippery meat dumplings topped with yogurt and meat sauce), or kado borani (tender roasted pumpkin with dried mint), or quabili pallow (the quintessential Afghan rice and lamb pilaf; more on this later), go tonight.But as for me, I had my heart set on Fremont.There are, in fact, two De Afghanan operations next to one another on the northern end of Fremont Boulevard: the itty-bitty Kabob House and ‚Äî here comes my favorite nondescriptive descriptor ‚Äî a ‚Äúsit-down‚Äù restaurant. The former is bare-bones: just a grill, a small range, a griddle, a cash register and an abbreviated menu. Contrary to the above distinction, you can sit down here too, provided you score one of the two cramped tables inside or the lone two-top outside.If, like me, you‚Äôve made a 45-minute trip from the city to have lunch in Fremont, you‚Äôll be forgiven for ordering liberally. But unless you‚Äôve come in a group of four or five, be assured that you will not finish your food. An order of bolani kachaloo ‚Äî a potato-filled griddle-fried flatbread ‚Äî comes cut into at least a dozen coaster-size pieces. The bread itself recalls a Chinese pancake, bubbly and sandy to the touch, crisp and chewy. The menu suggests that the filling is a mixture of potato and green onion, but the latter is scant and barely detectable. Overall, it‚Äôs pretty flavorless, save for the lightly vegetal taste of boiled potato, but I find it to be a perfectly suitable conveyance for large quantities of yogurt and thick house-made cilantro chutney.Kabobs come in four varieties: chicken, beef, lamb and chaplee ‚Äî a thin beef patty bound with egg and seasoned lightly with chile flake and scallion. I like the chaplee; it‚Äôs deeply browned on both sides but floppy-pliable and not at all dry. But the strongest case for driving all the way to Fremont for kabobs comes in the form of lamb. The knobby chunks of meat aren‚Äôt much to look at, but they‚Äôre succulent and slathered in a peppery herb paste. All kabob plates come with a fluffy hillock of basmati rice and a side of damp potato-and-chickpea salad that‚Äôs heavy on cilantro and pleasantly sour. You also get a scoop of fairly anonymous cucumber-and-tomato salad and a few squares of Afghan bread, dimpled and toasty.The diner next to me, man-spreading in spite of the restaurant‚Äôs tight quarters, groaned pleasurably with every other bite of chaplee. At one point, he called the cook over and asked for more ghore angoor. As the cook handed him a spice shaker of sumac, the diner pleaded with him to open a branch in San Jose.The kabobs are definitely better than the ones at the De Afghanan in San Francisco ‚Äî there‚Äôs something inimitable about dining in a little nook just a few feet from the grill.Am I advocating you make the trip to Fremont? I want you to, yes. While you‚Äôre in town, stop at Maiwand Market, another local culinary landmark, for a loaf of Afghan bread the size of a small quilt, fresh out of the oven for 2 bucks. But, truth be told, it‚Äôs a pretty mundane suburb. Despite what I‚Äôd read, there was no ‚ÄúLittle Kabul‚Äù to speak of ‚Äî no spoofy Afghan equivalent of Chinatown or Little Italy, at least.As a sort of self-check, I returned the next night for a lengthier meal at the sit-down De Afghanan with an acquaintance of Joe‚Äôs, another first-generation Afghan American who lives nearby in Union City. We shared kabobs, roasted eggplant that teetered on the precipice of falling apart into mush, squash-filled bolani ‚Äî superior, I think, to the potato version ‚Äî and a plate of quabili pallow. Meanwhile, I asked her impossible and inane questions. I wondered how it is that so many Afghan immigrants came to live in Fremont, of all places. She didn‚Äôt know what had brought her family, or others, to the area. It‚Äôs just like any community, right? Someone moved here and liked it, relatives followed and then others.As chance would have it, about a week later, I found myself having dinner with Joe at his parents‚Äô house. Joe‚Äôs mom had prepared her recipe for quabili pallow and it was as outstanding as ever ‚Äî a gargantuan platter of ethereal, beautifully perfumed rice and fork-tender lamb, bedecked with copious sweet raisins and carrots. My wife scooped me a small serving from the shared dish. Mom interceded, ‚ÄúNo, Joe, help her. Do it the Afghan way.‚Äù In other words, Joe, heap much, much more onto my plate. Thanks.I refuse to declare Joe‚Äôs mom‚Äôs quabili pallow as more or less ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù than the version at De Afghanan, but I will say without hesitation that hers was far superior, lighter, more flavorful. After we ate, I caught Joe up about my meals, and he immediately began to list all the various quibbles he had with De Afghanan and other Afghan spots, almost apologizing for the underseasoned bolani, the use of scallions instead of leeks (attributed to laziness) and a number of other perceived mistakes I hadn‚Äôt even noticed. But, Joe added, his family still goes to the restaurant. They still love it. Nitpicking the food is an affirmation of its existence. And even if I didn‚Äôt understand all his gripes, or how that dude could proclaim his love for the food while blasting it with sumac, at least I‚Äôd been there to see it for myself. I nodded my head as I listened.Why do communities form around seemingly random, run-of-the-mill suburbs? Because we like to be around people who will hear and understand that it sucks when a restaurant puts too much ice in the doogh or waters down the chutney, and why the lamb is good at one place but the mantoo is better at another. Why do I think it‚Äôs worth visiting these places? Because you‚Äôll be one step closer to understanding the conversation. Besides, how else are we going to finish all this food?

41.0,Other,"NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Police arrested a man Friday suspected of being the lookout during a robbery that led to the friendly fire death of a New York City police detective, an official briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press.The man was taken into custody in Queens hours after NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill revealed on a radio show that police were looking for a second suspect in Tuesday night's stick-up, the official said.The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. The suspect's name wasn't immediately available Friday night.Detective Brian Simonsen was hit once in the chest by crossfire as he and six other officers fired 42 shots at robbery suspect Christopher Ransom, who police say charged at them from inside a T-Mobile store pointing a fake handgun.Simonsen, 42, will be laid to rest next week.Ransom, who was wounded eight times, was arraigned Friday by video from his hospital bed on murder, manslaughter and other charges.A judge ordered him held without bail. His next court date is scheduled for Tuesday. Ransom faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted.The Legal Aid Society, which represents Ransom, cautioned people not to ""demonize"" him.""The loss of life and the serious injuries suffered by all are tragic,"" the an indigent defense organization said in a statement. ""But we ask the public to respect Mr. Ransom's right to due process and a presumption of innocence.""Ransom, 27, has a long rap sheet and a habit of bizarre stunts, styling himself on social media as a comedian and prankster in the vein of Sasha Baron Cohen of ""Borat"" fame.Ransom has been arrested at least 11 times since 2012, records show, and he was wanted by police in connection with a Jan. 19 robbery at another cellphone store. After one arrest, court papers show, Ransom was taken to a psychiatric ward.Ransom pleaded guilty to criminal trespass and was sentenced to 20 days in jail in 2016 after allegedly climbing over a gate and walking up to a desk at a Brooklyn police station while wearing a fake SWAT vest and police badge. Police records listed his alias as ""Detective.""Four years earlier, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to jail time for pretending to be an intern to gain access to a judge's chambers.A funeral for Simonsen, a 19-year veteran of the NYPD, is scheduled for Wednesday in Hampton Bays on Long Island, with viewings on Monday and Tuesday.Simonsen's supervisor and partner, Sgt. Matthew Gorman, was wounded in the leg . He was discharged from the hospital on Thursday.Simonsen, Gorman and six uniformed officers swarmed to the T-Mobile store at around 6:10 p.m. Tuesday after a 911 caller standing outside reported seeing a man take two employees to a back room at gunpoint, police said.According to a criminal complaint, Ransom ordered the employees to remove iPhones and money from the cash registers and back room safes.Simonsen and Gorman, who were both in plainclothes and not wearing bulletproof vests, were working on another case nearby when the call came and arrived around the same time as patrol officers, police said.Gorman and two of the uniformed officers went into the store, but retreated when Ransom emerged from a back room and came at them, police said. The gunshots blew out the store's doors, showering the sidewalk with glass.Simonsen stayed outside as Gorman and the uniformed officers went in, police said. Simonsen fired two shots. Gorman fired 11 times. It's not clear who fired the shots that struck them, police said.__"
48.0,Food,"When Jane Seabrook‚Äôs daughter was 4 days old, in 1999, Seabrook and her then-husband, Mark Green, decided it was time for their infant‚Äôs first outing. So they did what any other young Mission District family would do: They headed to the neighborhood bar.Of course, the couple also owned the neighborhood bar: the Lone Palm, the dark lounge on 22nd and Guerrero known ‚Äî then and now ‚Äî for its Art Deco interiors, white tablecloths and stiff, well-made drinks. Seabrook and Green had bought and refurbished the place in 1991, as a sort of accessory business to the nursery/tropical plant dealership, the Palm Broker, that Green already ran across the street.‚ÄúMark imports towering palms from So. Cal., sells them here for $1,000 to $4,000 each and does a brisk biz,‚Äù wrote Herb Caen in The Chronicle on Oct. 10, 1991, noting the bar‚Äôs opening. Green planted one queen palm on the sidewalk outside the bar ‚Äî it‚Äôs there to this day ‚Äî and the pair decided to call the place the Lone Palm.It was (and is) a cozy spot: charmingly laid back, but not too divey, great for a date or a casual after-work drink with friends. For a year or two there, after Seabrook and the bar‚Äôs former co-owner Nancy Myers both had their daughters within a week of each other, it was also a great baby bar.‚ÄúSeven days a week, it was either my baby or her baby in there with us while we worked, and then we started doing it where (customers) could bring their babies on Fridays,‚Äù recalls Seabrook. ‚ÄúBut then word got out and it got a little too popular and we had to shut it down. The whole bar was strollers and Baby Bjorns. A lot of mothers wanted a drink.‚ÄùTwenty years later, her infant is a college student. Seabrook and Green split up, and she bought out his share of the bar. The area has changed, as well: There are condos where the Palm Broker once stood; the Michelin-starred restaurant Aster is now the jewel of what was formerly a working-class neighborhood.But inside the Lone Palm, it might as well be the ‚Äô90s ‚Äî or even the ‚Äô40s. Past the awning with its neon sign, through the black curtain, you‚Äôll find a safe haven from the real world and a veritable playground for anachronists.About a dozen tables are draped with white tablecloths and illuminated by votives. Perpendicular to the front wall of glass tile there‚Äôs a wall with a kitschy, likely century-old Egyptian carving ‚Äî once a water feature, and a holdover from the previous bar, the 90-plus-year-old Mirage. It‚Äôs one thing Seabrook and Green promised their predecessor they‚Äôd keep.The cumulative effect lands somewhere between Morocco 1942 and Miami 1975. Either way it‚Äôs enough to make a nonsmoker want to light up, preferably with an ornate silver cigarette holder.On a recent rainy Sunday just past 9 p.m., two couples on dates lean toward each other across those white tablecloths, speaking in hushed tones while Hitchcock‚Äôs ‚ÄúDial M for Murder‚Äù plays silently on the small TV.At the bar, top-lit in neon pink and turquoise, seven patrons nurse beers (there are six on tap) or martinis (at $10, nearly double the size of your standard S.F. martini), cutting their booze with salt thanks to small glass dishes of the bar‚Äôs complimentary snack mix (the house-made savory-sweet concoction that earned an entire review to itself from SF Weekly last year). Talking Heads are on the speakers, until a mariachi player steps through the door, guitar in hand, and the bartender nods, wordlessly shutting off the music so the musician can perform.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to me to keep it as a space that‚Äôs kind of a magical refuge, an escape from everything outside,‚Äù says Seabrook, who has lived in Mill Valley for the past decade but still commutes to the bar five or six days a week. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve resisted going high-tech. For years, we had this classic old cash register that really told us nothing about inventory or sales, but I was so committed to it.‚Äù Finally, just a few years ago, she had to acknowledge that it was time for the business to get a computer.The bar‚Äôs clientele are, accordingly, the type of people who appreciate a spot that‚Äôs a little quirky ‚Äî and one that‚Äôs barely changed in 30 years. On a typical weeknight, Tinder dates and regulars from the neighborhood mingle with local artists, musicians and post-shift bartenders and servers from Beretta, Lolo and other Valencia Street hot spots ‚Äî all of whom are quick to name the spot as a favorite.Some of the bar‚Äôs clientele are also celebrities. Writer Daniel Handler, perhaps better known as children‚Äôs author Lemony Snicket, is a longtime fan; the bar has a long-standing relationship with the literary festival LitCrawl. The hip-hop supergroup Deltron 3030 chose the spot for shooting a music video, for ‚ÄúDo You Remember,‚Äù in 2014, as did the show ‚ÄúMythBusters,‚Äù in 2008, for an episode on the phenomenon of ‚Äúbeer goggles.‚Äù‚ÄúMad Men‚Äù actress Christina Hendricks has been in a few times with her husband, says Seabrook, while John Waters sightings are not uncommon. (Once asked by a fellow customer if he was, in fact, John Waters, the filmmaker is said to have responded ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm Steve Buscemi.‚Äù)But it‚Äôs the non-famous patrons who make up the fabric of the place. Scott Seiwald, who‚Äôs lived down the street and been a Lone Palm regular for the past 15 years, says it‚Äôs a tight-knit community. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a protective group,‚Äù says the San Francisco native, who can be found drinking a Cazadores Tequila most happy hours. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all walked people home, or called cabs, if there‚Äôs someone by themselves who‚Äôs had too much to drink. And most of the time there‚Äôs just the one person behind the bar, so you help them, too: plunge the toilet, mop the bathroom, clear the tables. Everyone pitches in.‚ÄùSeiwald loves the Lone Palm as much for what it doesn‚Äôt have as what it does: ‚ÄúIf you put in a pool table or a pinball machine, it would take away from the ambience,‚Äù he says definitively. Or a cocktail menu? ‚ÄúI get peeved when someone even puts a color movie on the TV. We should just be on a loop with ‚ÄòCasablanca.‚Äô‚ÄùStaying stuck in the 1940s might make for good vibes, of course, but the economic realities of running an older bar in San Francisco in 2019 still apply to the Lone Palm. Seabrook says her rent  increases every year. She reluctantly raises prices on drinks when she needs to, but what pains her more is that she used to pride herself on paying employees well above minimum wage, and that‚Äôs gotten harder over the years.To order: Martini ($10, or $8 during happy hour)Where: The Lone Palm, 3394 22nd St., S.F. 415-648-0109When: 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. dailyStill, she‚Äôs optimistic that the bar‚Äôs ability to hold on through the boom of the past half-decade bodes well for the future. ‚ÄúA few years back people were saying ‚ÄòOh, there won‚Äôt be singly owned bars anymore. It‚Äôs all going to be these groups of high-tech guys,‚Äô‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think that ever came to fruition. Who wants every bar to be owned by little chains? Don‚Äôt you want to have any unique character?‚ÄùOn this particular Sunday night, the mariachi player has finished his song to a polite round of applause. He does a lap around the small bar, collecting tips from a few people in a paper bag, thanking each customer profusely. And then he nods again at the bartender and the bartender nods back and turns the music on. A smiling couple stand to put on their coats, pay their tab, and head out together into the real world, into the rainy streets of San Francisco in 2019.It‚Äôs tough to tell, a week or so before Valentine‚Äôs Day, whether this was a first date or a fifth. But I‚Äôd bet money they‚Äôll be back. Because anachronistic interior design fans aside, there‚Äôs one group whose loyalty to the place never wavers: Folks who‚Äôve had especially successful dates at the Lone Palm wind up partial to the bar for life. ‚ÄúWe had a couple (recently) that said, ‚ÄòOh, we flew in from Boston to celebrate because we met here 18 years ago,‚Äô‚Äù says Seabrook. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some kind of magic in that room.‚Äù"
84.0,Other,"Historic Tony‚Äôs Seafood Restaurant, one of only a few food destinations in the quiet North Bay town of Marshall, will reopen this month after a substantial remodel of its 70-year-old Tomales Bay property. It‚Äôs a notable return considering Hog Island Oyster Co. took over the restaurant in 2017, continued service briefly during the summer and then shut down for renovations. The company went into the lengthy project with a goal of preserving Tony‚Äôs, opting to restore the space instead of demolishing it to start from scratch.‚Äú(T)hat would not have felt right in our small community,‚Äù the Hog Island team said via email. ‚ÄúWe wanted to restore what we could, clean it up and give the place some much needed TLC.‚ÄùTony‚Äôs Seafood Restaurant originally opened in 1948. It fell into the hands of Hog Island after former owners Anton and John Konatich decided to retire. The business joins a Hog Island roster of seafood spots scattered throughout the Bay Area, including outposts at San Francisco‚Äôs Ferry building, Napa‚Äôs Oxbow Public Market and the flagship farm in Marshall, which came to fruition in 1983 and began grilling its oysters for customers in 1989. Hog Island also leases 160 acres in Tomales Bay where the company farms and sells more than 3.5 million oysters, clams and mussels per year. Its hatchery resides in Humboldt Bay.According to the Hog Island camp, the wood panel walls and the restaurant‚Äôs wood ceiling were taken down, cleaned, sanded and refinished before being put back in place during the months of construction.A new wood floor was installed, along with new tabletops crafted from local cypress trees. The bar area facing Tomales Bay is now cement with oyster shell from the nearby oyster farm.And in a wink to Tony‚Äôs past, the old crab cooker in front of the restaurant will remain, though it‚Äôs not operational (for now).On the food side, the menu will ring familiar to former Tony‚Äôs regulars. The shop‚Äôs namesake barbecued oysters and burger are still available. See the menu here. Tony‚Äôs: 18863 Hwy 1, Marshall, Ca.; Winter hours: Friday, Saturday, Sunday 11:30 a.m. -8 p.m. and there will be a series of ticketed dinner events planned for Thursday nights; Spring opening hours will expand to Thursday through Monday 11:30 a.m. - 8 p.m. in April."
139.0,Other,"I knew I wanted to be a food writer. That‚Äôs why I went to culinary school. I figured that if I was going to do any justice to the pen and paper, I better know the ins and outs of the industry. But I couldn‚Äôt see a clear path on what to do with writing or where it would take me. My visit with Lula set the whole thing in motion. Suddenly, it became very clear.El Buren de Lula is a restaurant owned by an 82-year-old mystic named Maria Dolores de Jesus, also known as Lula. She has become a beacon of history and culture in the Puerto Rican town of Loiza, where descendants of slaves built their communities. It is considered the cradle of African traditions in Puerto Rico.Beginning at 7 o‚Äôclock in the morning, Lula can be seen pacing throughout her outdoor kitchen preparing food for sale. Like most Puerto Ricans, she has several calderos, bare aluminum pots that evenly conduct heat, all thin enough to create pegao ‚Äî the prized crispy rice at the bottom.But the real star here is the hot beast that dominates an entire side of the room: The buren.Once upon a time, the Taino, the island‚Äôs indigenous people, cooked either on open fires using woven surfaces made out of green wood (barbacoa) or the buren, a huge, flat surface made out of clay harvested from rivers and heated with stones.Lula mostly cooks pre-contact recipes, a lot of which feature coconut and cassava, on the buren. It has evolved into a metal plancha, the closest modern recreation possible of the Tainos‚Äô clay cooking surface.When you‚Äôre from a colony, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to track down the history of your food. Combine that with a long history of passing recipes down almost exclusively in an oratory form, and you‚Äôve got a disaster of no-documentation. Once it‚Äôs gone ... it‚Äôs gone.According to residents of Loiza, Lula is the last remaining institution who regularly uses the buren; she is a living, breathing piece of history. I received a notice the other day that she was ill. And after she passes, the craft could disappear.If Lula is the last connection to our pre-contact gastronomic world, should we be content with photos for the inevitable future ‚Äúanthropologist‚Äù who wants to teach a class on long-disappeared cooking techniques? While the younger generation loses the desire to create the food of our grandmothers ‚Äî favoring the addictive spell of American fast-food chains or the Eurocentric lullaby of soigne plating techniques ‚Äî perhaps it‚Äôs the task of the Disasporican to preserve the traditions of our ancestors.In the spring of 2015, I set out on a research trip to Puerto Rico. From the airport, our taxi shuffled through speeding cars as we flew past concrete housing developments, myriad satellite dishes reaching for the sky like vines to sunlight. This was not the Puerto Rico in the postcards. Financial turmoil was on the minds of many Puerto Ricans, both on the island and the mainland.We almost didn‚Äôt make it out to Lula. The day before proved to us that GPS was virtually useless and that maps only work if you have a general idea of where you‚Äôre going. We convinced a driver, Antonio Rivera Santiago, to take us out to Loiza. He proved a necessary force: historian, navigator, translator and diplomat. We finally pulled up to the ramshackle eatery hidden in a maze of unmarked alleys. As we walked into the open and dim kitchen with glassless windows, smoke billowed from the large metal flat top.There stood a stoic Lula, manning the entire buren on her own, fanning the fire, smearing a multitude of batters and discs of ingredients onto banana leaves and continuously shifting them around the buren into various temperature zones. When the heat started to die down, someone would go outside and feed coconut husks into the mouth of the pit under the buren.Lula was amused by our inquisition. Her assistant, who is like a daughter to her, brought various local fruits over to us straight from their limbs: cashew apples with the cashew nut attached, breadfruit, avocados and mangos. Lula didn‚Äôt blink as we peeked into the various pots containing sauces, gravies, rices and braises.Lula must have been convinced we‚Äôd be impressed with her yuca bread. She waved us in her direction, as if about to reveal a magic trick. She grabbed a simple wooden frame, placed it on the buren, dumped handfuls of cassava flour into the mold, made some impressions with a primitive wooden paddle and left it alone. She added nothing more than the flour ‚Äî no liquid, no fat. After a minute, she flipped the mold and showed us the bread. It was solid, golden brown and crispy. She told us to dip a piece into a bubbling cauldron of red liquid. The bread tasted like pure yuca, but with toasted nutty notes. Dipped into the seasoned red sauce, it mirrored the act of dipping bread into an Italian gravy. Magic.(A detour to talk about that flour: Many of us know yuca as cassava, a drought-tolerant woody tuber that has a waxy exterior and starchy interior, often interchanged with potatoes. Several days are dedicated to the process of making yuca flour. Wheelbarrows of yuca are peeled by hand, the white interior separated from its waxy brown skin and then cut into rough pieces. Then comes the washing, the mashing and the drying. The semi-dried mash is placed into an innovative tool: a pillowcase with one end tied around a baton and one end tied to a pole. Increments of the mash are placed inside the pillowcase and the pillowcase is squeezed tighter and tighter by hand, from the baton side, as the milky liquid falls into a collecting pan on the ground. This time the mash is dried thoroughly, sifted and stored for future use.)It was here that I was confronted with the possibility of regional Puerto Rican cuisine. When I asked Lula about arroz con gandules, she replied, ‚ÄúWe make arroz con jueyes around here.‚Äù Arroz con jueyes (crabs), with beans and pig‚Äôs feet. The blue land crabs of Puerto Rico ‚Äî hearty, stout creatures, with one claw that‚Äôs larger than the other ‚Äî burrow in the ground near the mangroves along the coast. People catch them in the night and keep them in coops, replacing their scavenger diet with sweet maize and young coconut.Lula‚Äôs arroz con jueyes was a punchy dish where sofrito and crab essence were front and center. Chunks of the crab stood in a mound on one side, with rice in the center and the beans with pig‚Äôs feet on the other side. Every bite was different. Some had strands of crab interlaced with bites of tomato-y rice. Others had beans with melty, gelatinous pig‚Äôs feet bits. Some had all of the above. It was the one dish no one asked me to share. It was the most soulful.After we gorged ourselves, I stood alone outside her restaurant and fed her chickens. The restaurant started to fill up. As the trade winds enveloped me, the voices of the patrons mingled with the soft boleros playing on the radio, and together they spilled out of the restaurant windows. I started to cry.I was sad that I couldn‚Äôt share that moment with my grandma and mother. And so I had to write about Lula to share that moment with them.Before Lula, I knew that I wanted to write about food. But it was the visit to her gastronomic museum that laid the foundation for the path that would become my id√©e fixe ‚Äî to be the one who told Puerto Rico‚Äôs food story.I may not be able to track down my ancestors, but I know they‚Äôre there. The one thing that remained unscathed was the food. Through cooking my grandmother‚Äôs food, I learned everything about her: strife, unrequited love, poverty. Every time I cook, I‚Äôm connecting with the phantoms.¬†"
111.0,Food,"I learned firsthand there would be two types of emotions running through my veins on a first date: excitement and nervousness. On one hand my biggest goal would be trying to stay calm, while on the other, I‚Äôd think I was going to collapse on the floor right in front of my date.As the designated time of a date approached, my insecurities would start to get the better of me. Was the blue shirt I wore too mellow? Would my lack of knowledge of classical music be an issue? What if my accent made me sound incomprehensible? I would move from sheer excitement to regret that I had ever said yes in the first place.We first met at the local coffee shop in my neighborhood when I was at school in Cincinnati. I was working on a school project with a group of classmates. He was a classical music student at the same school who had dropped by to grab a drink before class. It wasn‚Äôt some sort of romantic movie-esque magical moment ‚Äî our introduction manifested through a mutual friend. But we had an immediate connection, and he asked me out to dinner.A date is an experiment in risk-taking and believing in possibilities. Those were wise words of advice from my closest friend as she tried to assuage my fears. Despite my unsteady state of emotional turmoil, I heeded her advice and made my way to the restaurant in Hyde Park, where our dinner date was to be.Even in spring, Cincinnati has a reputation of staying pretty cold and windy, and this day was no exception. In addition to my usual winter gear, I‚Äôd wrapped my neck with a thick woolen scarf, and a hat covered most of my face. I prayed we wouldn‚Äôt run into each other outside the restaurant in the parking lot. This was not the way I wanted him to see me. (Dressing practically and attractively rarely go hand in hand.) Thankfully, luck was on my side. I got to the restaurant a few minutes before and waited.My date arrived on time, which I took to be a good omen. We sat down, exchanged the typical conversations about school, the cold weather and traffic. We ordered a few things and continued to talk, just like most couples on a first date who are trying to amass information  without coming across as intrusive.I found myself at ease as we spoke. The intense nervousness I had felt started to subside. But as dinner progressed, I learned that he had an absolute dislike of fruits and desserts. I quickly understood that I would have to forgo the final part of our dinner, even though the dessert menu had a lemon cake that I craved. So, feigning a shared dislike for all things sweet, I declined dessert. I regretted it instantly and went home that evening imagining what that lemon cake might have tasted like.We continued to date and see each other for a few months. But fruits or any type of sweets were always forbidden when we went out. I am unabashedly passionate about my love for ice creams and cakes and these became items I‚Äôd eat only when we weren‚Äôt together. It was never an option; my thoughts on the subject were never asked, and I knew they wouldn‚Äôt matter.As time passed, my enthusiasm for the local ice cream parlor‚Äôs Buckeye Blitz flavor (peanut butter cookie dough and dark chocolate chips) surpassed my desire to spend time with him. When it ended (not due to the ban on sweets), I wasn‚Äôt sorry or sad or filled with regret. A few days later, I went out to dinner with a few friends. When the time for dessert arrived, I ordered what my heart desired. It felt wonderful. It felt liberating.Nik Sharma‚Äôs first solo cookbook is ‚ÄúSeason‚Äù (Chronicle Books).

102.0,Food,"Owing to its geography, moody microclimates and vexingly challenged public transit system, a considerable part of San Francisco will always be far-flung. The Outer Richmond, for instance, unreachable by BART, is perpetually consigned to be thought of as ‚Äúway the hell out there.‚Äù As a Southern Californian by birth, I‚Äôve always found it perplexing that the beachfront property in San Francisco is, relatively speaking, among the least coveted. Karl, the personification of our city‚Äôs dogged blanket of ever-moving fog, has something to do with it, I‚Äôm sure.And so the city persists as one of residential neighborhoods and neighborhood restaurants.What is a ‚Äúneighborhood restaurant,‚Äù exactly? It‚Äôs a term that I hear used in all kinds of  scenarios ‚Äî as often when flashy places want to seem cozy as when mediocre places want to hide their faults. It carries something of a faux-populist vibe, as in, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a foodie place ‚Äî it‚Äôs a neighborhood joint.‚Äù Neighborhood restaurants exist, at various times, both above and beneath the attention of the modern restaurant hullabaloo. I suppose, at the most basic level, a neighborhood restaurant is one that serves the people in its neighborhood. But what happens when the neighborhood restaurant collides with talent and craft that aren‚Äôt so easily confined? What if a neighborhood restaurant has something to offer to those outside the neighborhood?There are moments whenever I eat at Cassava, when I think that, man, with a little work and a completely different location, this could be a great restaurant ‚Äî both delicious and consequential. As it stands, Cassava is a baby-blue bright spot in the Outer Richmond, with owners that wear their hearts on their sleeves.My first dinner there began with a warm hunk of bread, sourced from up the street at Marla Bakery. A rugged quenelle of honey butter sat shotgun at exactly the right temperature ‚Äî spreadable but not greasy. If, like me, you grew up not knowing any better than to eat at Kentucky Fried Chicken, Cassava‚Äôs bread service will whoosh you backward through time and space to the primal joys of spreading packets of honey on warm KFC biscuits. (At my next dinner, the bread was more than a little bit stale ‚Äî the sort of thing that happens, I suspect, when the kitchen tries to stretch the previous day‚Äôs loaf a little too far.)Speaking of fried chicken, Cassava fries a fine bird. The breading is crisp ‚Äî more cornstarch-y than flour-y, to my eye ‚Äî and threatens to fall off the meat but manages barely to cling on. Tart rounds of sliced kumquat brought a welcome sourness, but a hollandaise foam sauce on the side felt out of place. An intricately plated salad of endive and stone fruit slightly prioritized form over function. Red and white leaves of endive were shingled in a row with slices of peach, topped with breadcrumbs, soft cheese, pecans and more kumquat slices. It was handsome to behold, but made for uneven eating. Some bites lacked acidity or fat; others were spot on.Kumquats continued to run rampant into the entree courses, paired with a handful of orange segments atop hillocks of lentils on a plate of pan-fried halibut. The oranges ‚Äî odd-shaped little nubbins with the pith still intact ‚Äî added little to the dish, but didn‚Äôt really detract from what was, on the whole, a nice fish preparation. I like the way chef and co-owner Kris Toliao uses lettuces, tossing them with warm grains or vegetables to wilt them ever so slightly. They showed up this way, mingling with sauteed corn kernels in a duck confit dish, along with two other instances of corn: a sweet mush and a pan-fried purple polenta cake. Again, the dish as a whole was lovely, in spite of one element. The polenta cake‚Äôs subtle flavor immediately became impossible to perceive once I tasted anything else on the plate. The polenta cake made another appearance at my next dinner, when I returned to try Cassava‚Äôs $42 four-course tasting menu. That meal began with a better composed salad of stone fruit, radishes and greens. It was a delightful medley of textures ‚Äî sandy rye crumble, crunchy greens, ripe fruit, creamy house-made ricotta ‚Äî made more interesting with a small dose of cumin and a couple well-placed fennel fronds. If anything, it could have used a touch of acidity, but only because the fruit was so incredibly ripe. #californiaproblemsThe fish on this occasion was halibut, again served atop lentils, but this time with peeled cherry tomatoes that brought a welcome burst of brightness, and thin slices of pickled watermelon rind that were delicious but scant. The polenta cake showed up in the game hen course, and was again overwhelmed by its plate mates. The hen, though attractively browned and appealingly scented with rosemary, tasted like it had been cooked ‚Äî or par-cooked ‚Äî too long ago. One of the hazards of dining at 9 p.m. on a slow night, I suppose.Dessert was a custardy honey-lavender panna cotta, advertised with an accompanying berry compote that turned out not to be a compote so much as a small spoonful of berries and a few slices of fresh fruit. Still, it was tasty, owing again to the exceptional quality of the fruit. The lavender in the panna cotta was mercifully not hand-soap-y, as I tend to fear, and a few small mint leaves were wonderfully complementary. Forty-two bucks is an absolute steal for a meal of this caliber and quantity, but I hesitate to call it a ‚Äútasting menu.‚Äù That phrase gets thrown around too easily. Tasting menus should be crafted with a narrative in mind, conveyed through dishes that are not complete unto themselves. In other words, the meat+veg+starch formula that dictates how most restaurants define an entree shouldn‚Äôt apply to the dishes on a tasting menu. What I had at Cassava for $42 was a salad, two mains and a dessert. Toliao has worked at Kikunoi, the famed kaiseki restaurant in Japan, so I‚Äôm sure he knows how the very best seasonal tasting menus are able to unfold and reveal themselves over multiple courses. Maybe he feels like he needs to give us our money‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs generous, but leaves me curious to see what he might do with a proper tasting menu.
Cassava also serves breakfast, brunch and lunch. This strikes me as somewhat bonkers.One morning, shortly before I was to depart for Japan myself, I popped in to try their version of a Japanese breakfast. It consisted of an assortment of bowls and ramekins filled with rice, miso soup and various accompaniments: lightly sweet pickles, a small piece of broiled sea bass, baby broccoli dressed in sesame, a sous-vide egg and a small dish of natto (fermented soybeans) for which I paid a few extra dollars. I arrived during the half-hour overlap between breakfast and lunch, so I decided to dip into the afternoon menu as well, ordering a dish of meatballs in curry, and a slice of avocado toast. The perfectly nice meatballs were smothered in a tomato-y curry, along with chunks of chewy-creamy paneer that felt like an ideal cross between tofu and soft cheese.Cassava pours a beautiful cup of siphon-brewed coffee from Ritual Roasters, and, in spite of a slightly overcooked egg on my avocado toast and too much arugula filler, I left breakfast feeling totally impressed. I marvel at what the kitchen at Cassava is able to produce from a tiny room outfitted with induction cooktops and a La Marzocco espresso machine that seemingly occupies half of the available counter space.Yet there are downsides to always going above and beyond. There are aspects of Cassava that feel strained: the service at certain times is fraught, and I‚Äôve already mentioned how some of the ingredients can be overstretched. Cassava‚Äôs co-owner and general manager, Yuka Ioroi, occasionally maintains a blog, in which she refers to the restaurant as ‚Äúthe DIY restaurant.‚Äù You can tell they‚Äôre bootstrapping it, and it shows ‚Äî for better or worse. There‚Äôs a lot of ambition and talent and devotion here. Part of me wishes I could transport the restaurant out of its neighborhood setting. I have no idea if that‚Äôs what Ioroi or Toliao or their customers want, but I think they‚Äôd  flourish with more of a challenge and perhaps some additional room to work. Obviously, I can‚Äôt move the restaurant ‚Äî and who knows if they‚Äôd succeed anyway. But I urge you to get out there for yourself to see the improbably outstanding work they‚Äôre doing with what they‚Äôve got. Chris Ying is a writer, editor and co-founder of Lucky Peach.

11.0,Biz+Tech,"Levi Strauss & Co. prides itself on its corporate citizenship and gets high marks from outfits that rate firms based on ‚Äúenvironmental, social and governance‚Äù criteria. So it was jarring to see the venerable jeans maker planning to go public with two share classes.Existing shareholders will get 10 votes per share while those who buy in the initial public offering will get only one.Having shares with unequal voting rights ‚Äúis the opposite of good governance,‚Äù said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Institutional investors are strongly opposed to unequal voting rights; index funds bristle at having to buy companies with multiple share classes when they are part of an index they track. Big investors went ballistic when Snap, in its 2017 offering, sold stock with no voting rights.After that, some index providers decided to exclude companies with dual share classes from certain indexes going forward ‚Äî including the S&P 500 index.Levi‚Äôs cites that as a risk factor in its prospectus: ‚ÄúS&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have recently announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500.‚ÄùIt added that several stockholder advisory firms oppose multiple class structures and might ‚Äúpublish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure.‚Äù These factors could ‚Äúresult in a less active trading market‚Äù and ‚Äúadversely affect the value of our Class A common stock,‚Äù it said.Glass Lewis is one of the shareholder advisory firms that opposes multiple share classes. ‚ÄúThe idea of having one vote per share, having voting rights equal to your economic ownership, is a key tenet of corporate governance,‚Äù said Kern McPherson, vice president of research and engagement with Glass Lewis. Giving founders and early shareholders super voting rights ‚Äúis intended to insulate the management team from outside pressure they are suddenly faced with when they become a public company.‚ÄùElson said he was surprised that Levi‚Äôs is adopting unequal voting rights considering the way it describes itself in its prospectus.‚ÄúOur founder, Levi Strauss, was committed to integrity, philanthropy and good corporate citizenship,‚Äù it says. ‚ÄúTo this day, we continue to operate our company with these values through an approach we call ‚Äúprofits through principles.‚Äù‚ÄôLater it says, ‚ÄúThroughout our long history, we have upheld our strong belief that we can help shape society through civic engagement and community involvement, responsible labor and workplace practices, philanthropy, ethical conduct, environmental stewardship and transparency.‚ÄùAnd Levi‚Äôs does get good marks in many of those categories.CSRHub, which aggregates data from hundreds of  sources that rates companies based on their environmental, social and governance behavior, gives Levi‚Äôs a 68 on a scale of 1 to 100. However, very few companies rate below 40 or above 70, so Levi‚Äôs is actually in its 99th percentile of all companies, said Cynthia Figge, CEO of CSRHub.MSCI, which rates companies on the same factors from AAA to CCC, gives Levi‚Äôs a AA rating, said Bob Goldstein, CEO of Sonen Capital, which focuses on impact and sustainable investing. The company ‚Äúis a very good steward of the environment and natural resources,‚Äù he said, and also rates high on supply-chain labor standards.They also do well on some measures of corporate governance. Levi‚Äôs separates the role of chairman and CEO, and its president and CEO, Charles Bergh, is the only member of the 11-person board who is not independent. That‚Äôs very unusual; most public companies have more insiders on the board.However, once Levi‚Äôs goes public, its corporate governance ratings will almost certainly change, Figge said.Despite investor complaints, dual share classes have become increasingly popular with companies,  especially in tech and media. Google went public in 2004 with the motto ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù and two share classes that guaranteed its two founders and then-CEO Eric Schmidt would retain voting control. It later issued a third share class with no voting rights.The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Lyft founders John Zimmer and Logan Green plan to take near-majority voting control when it goes public this year, despite owning less than 10 percent of the company.‚ÄúIt has been a discouraging week between Lyft and Levi,‚Äù said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors. He said institutions are almost unanimously opposed to multiple share classes.The Levi‚Äôs IPO comes at a time when investing in companies with positive environmental, social and governance attributes, so-called ESG investing, is gaining popularity, especially with younger investors. It will be interesting to see if Levi‚Äôs good marks on the first two factors outweigh any negative ones it will most likely get from its dual-share-class structure."
9.0,Biz+Tech,"Despite his penchant for building multimillion-dollar dream estates, Lowell Strauss likes to keep a low profile. The business he runs with his wife, Jacqueline, Amalfi West, has no website, and Strauss sidesteps social media.‚ÄúIn a past life, I was a software architect, so I am supposed to love technology,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe truth is I don‚Äôt. I would prefer to live a more holistic life without social media and the like.‚ÄùStrauss hails from Waterloo, an Ontario town about 90 minutes from Toronto. He worked in construction during high school and college and grew up in a house his father designed. Strauss‚Äô father ultimately became a commercial real estate developer and builder, after dropping out of high school to run his parent‚Äôs press shop.‚ÄúI have an appreciation of design and architecture in my blood,‚Äù Strauss said. ‚ÄúAnd my wife is multitalented and we really complement each other when we do one of these projects.‚ÄùDetails: Builder/developer of high-end estates along the California coast. Portfolio includes 10 Margarita Drive in San Rafael; 9 Woodside Way in Ross and 460 Ridge Road in Tiburon. Owned by Lowell and Jacqueline Strauss, the firm‚Äôs next project, 135 Belvedere Ave. in Tiburon, is a $65 million estate with more than 12,000 square feet of living space, a private pier and sweeping views from the Golden Gate Bridge to downtown San Francisco. The Strausses also operate Oceanfront Retreats, a separate but related business focused on vacation rental properties.Email: lowelljstrauss@gmail.com.That connection to nature and the elements drives his design philosophy.He credits this appreciation to his interactions with the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe, indigenous peoples found in Northwestern Ontario.‚ÄúWhen I was younger, I spent months each year planting trees and living deep in the northwestern Ontario wilderness. I lived in a tent, and worked alongside native people, who had this otherworldly contentedness to nature. Indigenous people have a connection to the Earth that we have lost,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt may sound ridiculous, a guy building multimillion-dollar homes talking about these things, but this is what inspires my wife and I.‚ÄùIn this interview with The Chronicle, Strauss talks about how he and his wife select building sites, the biggest hurdles he faces and an engineering advancement that‚Äôs fundamentally changed the way they design.Q: How do you select sites for development?A: We invest in real estate all along the coast. We look for unique and spectacular natural settings. We are very selective about the properties we purchase. Every property has to speak to us for some reason or another. We trend toward spectacular views, oceanfront homes or land with a natural element that sets them apart. Topography is very important since we look for sites that allow for indoor/outdoor living. Having the topography that allows for easy access to the outdoors without much effort but still allows for privacy, expansive outdoor spaces and best views is very challenging.Q: What‚Äôs the most challenging part of your job?A: Usually it‚Äôs the design review process, and sometimes dealing with unfriendly neighbors. It‚Äôs very hard not to take it personally when you are so passionate about what you are doing. I mean, yes, we are developers and are out to make a profit, but that is not what drives our process. We don‚Äôt even think about budget when we design something. We think about creating the greatest thing we can imagine, and an integral part of that is how that thing fits into the natural environment. I think our work in the end speaks for itself. For us, leaving something magnificent behind, that people can walk past, and it really makes them happy, just like when you first look at a magnificent piece of art, that‚Äôs everything to us.Q: How do you go about selecting fits and finishes for a home?A: The materials must serve a purpose in terms of how we want a particular space to feel. Every room in our houses has something special about it. We try and always use natural materials like stone, wood, steel or concrete to speak to that. Stone, to me, is very emotional. We once took slabs of fossilized boulders from an ancient landslide and sandblasted them. We used them to panel the walls of a bathroom and it created this incredible three-dimensional effect that people really responded to.Our Belvedere project has these incredible indoor/outdoor spas in some of the key bathrooms, and will be made from stone slabs with a leathered finish, which will make sitting in them feel soft, sexy and supple.Q: What enables you to have such substantial indoor/outdoor living designs?"
101.0,Other,"Stock recipes are personal. A stock in many ways is a reflection of you, where you‚Äôve been and where you‚Äôve lived: a pot of water slowly infused over time and flavored by your life experiences.The applications might be familiar, but the creation of a stock reflects its land, region and people. A recipe for a stock can be a highly guarded treasure, handed down in families through generations. And one might argue rightly so, because a stock is the building block to many dishes. A stock can become a clear French consomm√©, or it could form the base of Vietnamese pho in which noodles and thin shavings of tripe might be served. It might be used to maintain humidity and bump up the flavor in a roasted chicken or used to braise a cabbage in a pot. The applications are endless, which makes stock recipes an invaluable asset of any kitchen.My uncle worked at a famous hotel in Bombay (Mumbai), India. He once told me about the stocks prepared by the chefs  behind the closed doors of the kitchen: large pots simmering endlessly on the stoves with one or two younger chefs tasked with ensuring the stock was always ready to go. Carcasses of bones and chopped vegetables would go into these enormous pots that they would cook for hours, until the bones would break and crumble to the bottoms, allowing the marrow to escape into the water.I find the nuances of stocks across cuisines to be quite beautiful. For example, celebrated cookbook author Andrea Nguyen (‚ÄúVietnamese Food Any Day‚Äù 2019, Ten Speed Press) makes her chicken pho stock with the subtle yet elegant notes of ginger, onion, cilantro sprigs, coriander seeds and cloves.In high school, I would visit a friend‚Äôs house for delicious Thai food. His mother grew up in Thailand and her chicken broth was infused with a few makrut lime leaves; that citrusy component would make all the difference in the world.My own version of chicken stock is a bit different than what you might see elsewhere. I start with olive oil (though my grandmother would use a bit of ghee or butter). I like to brown the chicken on the skin side to add a bit of complexity to the flavor. My preference is for a highly aromatic stew, so I use spices like cinnamon, green cardamom and cloves. This stock still carries a strong chicken flavor so it can make something as simple as boiled rice flavorful, or it can make a delightful broth for my alphabet noodle soup on a cold winter night.Nik Sharma‚Äôs first solo cookbook is ‚ÄúSeason‚Äù (Chronicle Books). Email: food@sfchronicle.comRecipe: My Chicken StockThis is the stock I freeze in batches and keep on hand to add to my rice-based pilafs and biryanis, couscous, braises, roasts and my soups, stews and curries.

27.0,US & World,"Irate neighbors have sued the University of California to try to stop a beach volleyball complex UC Berkeley is planning, claiming the campus illegally skirted a required environmental impact review.Four neighborhood groups representing hundreds of Berkeley residents claim the women‚Äôs volleyball facility ‚Äî four courts, locker rooms, 40-foot field lights and a public address system ‚Äî would be too loud and too bright for the area. They say the 14,000-square-foot complex at Sports Lane and Dwight Way also would violate development restrictions established in 1979 for the university‚Äôs Clark Kerr Campus.‚ÄúThe project includes large gatherings of 50 or more people, amplified sound, crowd noises including cheering, and operation of lights,‚Äù says the lawsuit filed Friday in Alameda County Superior Court by neighborhood associations representing Claremont Elmwood, Panoramic Hill and Dwight Hillside, as well as the Save Berkeley‚Äôs Neighborhoods group and its president, Phillip Bokovoy. The groups claim that 400 spectators could swamp the area.University officials say they are mystified by the complaints.The Clark Kerr Campus already has volleyball courts, and the new ones are planned for the middle of the campus, said Dan Mogulof, spokesman for UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ.‚ÄúNo part of this project is for the benefit of spectators, just the players,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSand volleyball games attract, at most, about 50 people per game. ... There is absolutely nothing in our plans that will lead to new, additional impacts on neighbors who live far from, and out of eyesight of, the court location.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs why campus officials declared themselves exempt from having to pursue an environmental impact report from the state, Mogulof said, adding that such reviews are costly and time-consuming, especially if not warranted.As set as the neighbors are to crush the plan, UC Berkeley appears set to pursue it. Christ, the chancellor, described it last summer as a moral imperative for the university.That‚Äôs when she announced a $30 million plan to upgrade women‚Äôs sports and better comply with federal Title IX gender equity regulations: $5 million for the volleyball, and $25 million to upgrade the softball field at Strawberry Canyon.Those are necessary ‚Äúif we are to remain true to our moral, ethical and legal commitments,‚Äù she said.But Christ‚Äôs announcement came even as the campus has slashed academics and reduced other expenses to try and pay down a $110 million budget deficit ‚Äî now at $40 million, including a $19 million deficit in the athletics department ‚Äî that snowballed partly because of costly athletics projects like the $321 million renovation of Memorial Stadium in 2012, a $153 million training facility the same year and an $18 million aquatic center since then.The Berkeley neighbors have little sympathy for the university‚Äôs woes. The new lawsuit against UC Berkeley is the second by Bokovoy and his Save Berkeley‚Äôs Neighborhoods group, which sued in April on grounds the campus is so over-enrolled that it negatively affects Berkeley‚Äôs quality of life.The suit filed Friday says that an environmental impact report from 1979, when UC Berkeley acquired its Clark Kerr Campus from what used to be a school for deaf or blind students, specified that ‚Äúno rock concerts or other noisy activities‚Äù could be scheduled, including any with spectators, among other requirements.‚ÄúWe have tried to work with UC Berkeley over several months to determine the scope and impact of this project, but they have refused to provide us with any meaningful documents and to formally agree to any mitigation concerning light, noise, attendance and parking impacts,‚Äù Bokovoy said. ‚ÄúWe had no choice but to sue.‚ÄùThe groups hope to force the university to go through an environmental review and to stop the project altogether.Mogulof, speaking for the university, disputed the claims."

83.0,Food,"Want all the pleasures of harvesting garden vegetables but worried about conserving water? Make January-March (the ‚Äúsecret season‚Äù) an important part of your gardening year. By starting now, you can take advantage of late-winter and spring rains. Just a little planning in January and February can bring you delicious harvests from March through June, usually with very little supplemental watering. Many vegetables are hardy enough for January or February planting, and a few benefit from starting indoors.In some cases, planting at this time of year will require special varieties: Choose ‚Äúearly‚Äù cabbage, broccoli or cauliflower varieties, small-rooted radishes, and varieties of radicchio, Florence fennel or celeriac described as OK for spring planting. Top picks for ‚Äúsecret season‚Äù gardens Radish: Direct sow seed in garden. Harvest in 20-30 days. Plant small-rooted varieties such as ‚ÄòFrench Breakfast,‚Äô ‚ÄòCherry Belle‚Äô or ‚ÄòIcicle‚Äô at this time of year. Sometimes cabbage root maggots damage radish after mid-March. If damage occurs, don‚Äôt resow until October.Kale and collards, broccoli, gai lan, cabbage, cauliflower: Direct sow or use seedlings for kale or collards. Use purchased or homegrown seedlings of broccoli, gai lan, cabbage or cauliflower. Pot up or plant out before seedling roots become crowded. Starting early lets young plants grow without root maggot or cabbage worm damage that can occur after mid-March.Leeks: Sow in place or start seed inside. An early start, plus good, rich soil and enough water can produce large leeks in summer and fall.Onion: Start seed inside in January or February, or plant seeds, purchased plants or sets (small bulbs) in February. To avoid worry about getting planting time just right, use day-neutral varieties such as ‚ÄòSuper Star,‚Äô ‚ÄòCandy‚Äô or ‚ÄòRed Candy Apple.‚ÄôLettuce: Purchase seedlings or grow your own. Varieties that handle cold best are loose-leaf and some Romaine types (read variety descriptions). You may need to cover young plants with polyester row cover (from a nursery) with edges tucked tightly into the soil to avoid bird damage.Peas: Best sown in place. Until they are 3 to 4 inches tall, protect seedlings from slugs and birds with polyester row cover. Plant peas next to a sturdy trellis on which they are to climb; even bush varieties will appreciate support. Snap peas or snow peas are a better crop for a small garden than shelling peas are. Choose varieties resistant to powdery mildew.Arugula: Sow seed in place. It‚Äôs easy to grow and can be harvested by the leaf for several weeks. (The flavor of cooked arugula is mild; saute briefly and serve with pasta.)Parsley: In cold weather, growing your own seedlings inside will be more satisfactory because the seeds are slow to germinate, and inside temperature will speed them up a bit. Plant flat-leaf varieties to use in cooking. Let plants flower to attract beneficial insects, and let them drop seed that will regrow in your garden.Cilantro: Direct sow seed in the garden. Seedlings come up in pairs; cut one off if you have plenty of seedlings. Choose varieties that are advertised as  ‚Äúslow to bolt.‚Äù When plants do bolt (form flowering stems), you can still eat any tender parts, including the flowers. If plants bloom and drop ripe seeds, they may regrow and give you another harvest. What to plant in the garden Note: In the following lists, the asterisk (*) means the crop is best suited to a larger garden (usually because most gardeners don‚Äôt consider the rewards from only a few plants worth the trouble).Direct sow these seeds in January:ArugulaCilantroCollardsLeekKaleMustardParsleyRadishIn February: All of the above, plus:BeetCarrotFava beanLettucePeaPotato (use seed potatoes from a nursery, small potatoes intended for planting) Set plants of these crops in your garden In January:CabbageCollardsKaleOnion (seeds, plants, or sets)Rhubarb (rootstock)Swiss chardIn February: All of the above plus:*Artichoke (rootstocks or seedlings)Broccoli and gai lan (Chinese broccoli)Cauliflower*Celeriac*Florence fennel*KohlrabiLeeksLettuce Grow your own seedlings indoors Starting seeds indoors lets you select the best varieties and have them when you want them. The basic plan is to plant seeds in moist potting mix and put the containers in a warm place until seedlings emerge, keeping the mix moist but not soggy. Then move the containers to a very bright place until the plants are big enough to plant out. Here are the important details:The container should be 2-3 inches deep and have drainage holes. Reused nursery cell packs are good, or tofu containers punched for drainage; egg cartons are too shallow. Recycled plastic trays from grocery purchases make good saucers to prevent water from damaging indoor surfaces.Don‚Äôt overplant, as seedlings are tricky to separate without damaging their roots. When you first plant the seeds, water until the container drips, drain the tray, and then water only a tiny bit whenever the surface is dry. Don‚Äôt water to the dripping point again until seedlings are growing well. Make sure to add a label with the variety and date. (Recycled popsicle sticks make good labels.)The warm place could be on top of a refrigerator or other appliance. If seedlings don‚Äôt appear in the number of days listed on the seed packet, that probably means the location isn‚Äôt warm enough. In this case, buy a plastic electric warming mat (available at local nurseries or from Gardeners Supply at www.gardeners.com). For just a few seedlings, you‚Äôll need only the smallest size and not the separate thermostat.Check daily. As soon as the first bit of even one seedling breaks the surface, move the seeding container next to the brightest window you have. Rotate it daily to keep seedlings from leaning to the light. Seedlings should be stocky; except for leeks and onions, which should be as wide as they are tall. If they are spindly and narrow, your window is not bright enough. In this case, buy or make a seed-starting light fixture. It can be as simple as a 4-foot shop light with seedlings kept 6 inches from the light. (You can place the container on a pile of books or bricks; remove books or bricks as the seedlings grow.)In some cases, it is wise (or at least possible) to pot up seedlings into a slightly larger container for a week or more before you plant them out. Disturb roots as little as possible; water thoroughly after repotting. (See ‚Äúpot up‚Äù notes.)Before you plant seedlings outdoors, put them outside in shade for two or three days, then all night, then move them to sun. Avoid harsh outside weather, such as strong winds or icy nights in this ‚Äúhardening off‚Äù period. Then plant them in their final location and give a good watering. Water to keep soil moist if rain is not sufficient, but rain is usually enough through April, and maybe longer. Start these seeds indoors late December through February¬† The week span is the time this crop will require from when you start the seeds to when they‚Äôre ready to transplant into the garden. Note that many will do best when transplanted into a slight larger container during the time span when they are becoming crowded in the seeding container.*Artichoke, 8-12 weeks; potting up optionalBroccoli, 5-7 weeks; pot upCabbage, 5-7 weeks; pot upCauliflower, 5-7 weeks; pot up*Celeriac, 10-12 weeks; pot upCollards, 5-7 weeks; pot up*Florence fennel, 4-6 weeks; do not pot upGai lan, 5-7 weeks; pot upBeginner‚ÄôsvocabularyDirect sow or sow in place: Plant the seeds directly in the garden.Set plants in the garden: Plant seedlings.Rootstock: A dormant section of root and plant base.Pot up: Transplant the seedling into a larger container when it becomes too big.If you have a spot that gets sun part of the day and isn‚Äôt too windy, you can grow food in containers. Match plant size to depth of container ‚Äî a pot that‚Äôs 6 to 10 inches deep for lettuce, arugula, radish, green onion, cilantro or spinach; 10 to 15 inches deep for chard, Chinese cabbage, gai lan, leek, onion, beet, short carrot varieties; 15 to 18 inches deep for kale, collards, broccoli, cauliflower or artichoke.Plant in container filled to about an inch from the top with potting mix, to which you could have added a few handfuls of earthworm castings or slow-release chemical fertilizer (following directions on package). Use a small piece of fiberglass window screen to cover drainage holes (pot shards impede drainage).Pay close attention to water needs of container plants. Chances are rain will keep them moist till mid-April, but small volumes of mix dry out faster than open soil. When dry, water to 1 inch below the surface. If a night promises to be very cold, you can move container plants under an overhanging part of a building or indoors.Kale, 5-7 weeks; pot up*Kohlrabi, 5-7 weeks; pot upLeek, 10-12 weeks; potting up optionalLettuce, 3-6 weeks; potting up optionalOnion, 8-10 weeks; potting up optionalSwiss chard, 4-6 weeks; pot upRadicchio, 4-5 weeks; potting up optionalHigh Mowing Seeds.(www.highmowingseeds.com, 866-735-4454Johnny‚Äôs Selected Seeds (www.johnnyseeds.com, 877-564-6697Pinetree Garden Seeds (www.superseeds.com, 207-926-3400Territorial Seed Company (www.territorialseed.com, 800-626-0866 Pam Peirce is the author of ‚ÄúGolden Gate Gardening.‚Äù Visit her website, www.pampeirce.com Email: food@sfchronicle.com"

1.0,Other,"While millions more Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers could now have their power intentionally turned off as part of a wildfire-prevention effort, the utility is also taking steps to keep blackouts as limited as possible, one of its key executives said Wednesday.PG&E is expanding the power shutoff program it launched after the deadly 2017 fires, many of which were linked to its equipment. Now any of its 5.4 million electric customers could be in the dark at some point as the utility tries to prevent its power lines from starting more dangerous fires during periods of extremely dry and windy weather.At the same time, PG&E is trying to contain the impact of its power shutoffs by installing more devices that allow it to more closely target the portions of its system that are de-energized, said Sumeet Singh, a vice president in charge of the company‚Äôs community wildfire safety program.Singh made the point at a San Francisco workshop on the wildfire mitigation plans that the state‚Äôs investor-owned utilities, including PG&E, submitted last week to the California Public Utilities Commission.As he discussed PG&E‚Äôs plan, Singh acknowledged that the company‚Äôs decision to broaden the scope of planned outages inevitably means that customers who are not located in a high-risk fire area could lose power at some point. So the utility is installing additional ‚Äúsectionalization devices‚Äù that will help lessen the impact of power shutoffs on customers who are outside high-risk zones but are served by power lines that run through them, he said.Singh also outlined other elements of PG&E‚Äôs wildfire prevention program, which includes removing 375,000 trees and managing vegetation more aggressively along 2,450 miles of power lines this year. PG&E says it is also installing 400 new weather stations and 70 fire-watching cameras this year ‚Äî and many more in future years ‚Äî among other efforts.Asked if PG&E‚Äôs recent bankruptcy protection filing will hurt the company‚Äôs fire prevention efforts, Singh said it should not.‚ÄúAt this point, we do not foresee that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have a committed, unwavering focus on safety. ... We will continue to do our part, working in unison with the communities and customers on addressing this unprecedented level of risk.‚ÄùPG&E‚Äôs fire plan comes with high stakes, as the state has already blamed the company‚Äôs power lines for a series of wildfires that tore through Northern California in 2017 ‚Äî though not the most destructive blaze from that year. The utility may also still be found responsible for last year‚Äôs devastating Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive blaze in state history.The plan is also of great interest to the federal judge overseeing PG&E‚Äôs probation arising from the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion, who is considering imposing his own sweeping wildfire-prevention proposal on the utility. The judge ordered PG&E to submit a copy of its wildfire mitigation plan to him as well last week, and comments from parties in the case are due next Wednesday.The plan outlined by Singh was met with some skepticism at the commission workshop.Elizaveta Malashenko, the commission‚Äôs deputy executive director for safety and enforcement policy, questioned whether PG&E had the ‚Äúorganizational capabilities to really do this much that fast with everything that‚Äôs going on.‚Äù She also wondered whether PG&E‚Äôs focus on aggressive vegetation management could have unintended consequences, possibly increasing the fire threat if trees are haphazardly trimmed or cut.‚ÄúI appreciate the scale of what PG&E is doing, but I think there‚Äôs some concerns, on the other side of it, that it‚Äôs not just about numbers ‚Äî it‚Äôs really about doing things right,‚Äù Malashenko said.Singh said the company‚Äôs fire prevention plan was based on what it had a ‚Äúline of sight into‚Äù and assured it was taking steps to manage vegetation properly, including sending people out to review the work after it‚Äôs done.One workshop attendee, Robin McCollum, criticized PG&E‚Äôs entire approach to vegetation management. McCollum, who said he formerly supervised tree trimming for the Butte County government, told Singh he considered PG&E‚Äôs vegetation management ‚Äúto have largely been a failure.‚Äù‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre at a point where we should have a paradigm shift in our thinking: It‚Äôs not the vegetation that causes the problem. It‚Äôs not the vegetation that‚Äôs the enemy or the target,‚Äù McCollum said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the wires ‚Äî the bare wires ‚Äî that are the hazard.‚ÄùThe commission has two more technical workshops planned this month and may hold evidentiary hearings in March. Commissioners intend to adopt the utilities‚Äô fire plans before the start of the next wildfire season in June, though Malashenko cautioned against expecting too much immediately.‚ÄúThis is not going to happen overnight,‚Äù she said in an interview. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only so much we can do in the next 90 days. I think a realistic expectation is that, from this first round of wildfire mitigation plans, we will establish a baseline and chart out a path forward to further improvements in the next cycle.‚Äù"
137.0,Food,"Because every special beer issue deserves a good, old-fashioned barstool debate, we asked some of The Chronicle‚Äôs top beer lovers ‚Äî ahem, experts ‚Äî a simple question: Which beers belong on the Mount Rushmore of Northern California beer?That is, as we consider the state of local craft brewing for Beer Week 2017, which four beers are the region‚Äôs most important, iconic, influential and delicious?It‚Äôs a question that sparked much debate in our office, and hopefully will be a fun conversation for you, too. Share your four picks and join the discussion on social media with the hashtag #FourBayBeers. Esther Mobley, Chronicle wine, beer and spirits writer  Anchor Steam. This is the easy call: the absolute, undisputed OG of San Francisco beer ‚Äî arguably of American craft beer. You could make a case for other Anchor beers (Liberty Ale, the first West Coast IPA, or Christmas Ale, because it‚Äôs so unabashedly, kitschily San Francisco), but I‚Äôve got to give this to the steam beer. It‚Äôs been Anchor‚Äôs signature since the 19th century, decades before Fritz Maytag bought the company and transformed it into the craft-beer icon it is today. Obviously Anchor Steam is George Washington. I dare anyone to dispute this.North Coast Old Rasputin. First of all, North Coast Brewing (in Fort Bragg, a place once settled by Russian immigrants) started making this 9% alcohol, mega-rich, malt bomb way before people were used to drinking such full-flavored beer ‚Äî which is a classic California beer trailblazing move. It‚Äôs also one of the best Imperial Russian Stouts on the market, IMHO. And I know, I know, Fort Bragg is technically outside of the nine-county ‚ÄúBay Area,‚Äù but when it opened in 1988 there were so few breweries in Northern California that I‚Äôm gonna say it gets grandfathered in.Russian River Brewing Pliny the Younger. I was tempted to say Pliny the Elder, the more democratic of Russian River Brewing Co.‚Äôs ancient Roman-inspired IPAs. But what single beer could capture the contemporary sense of the craft-brewing craze better than Younger, the ultra-hoppy triple IPA that draws thousands of people to wait in line for hours (days!) at the Santa Rosa brewery every February? It encapsulates ‚Äúcult‚Äù as no other California beer can.Fort Point KSA. OK, this is the shocker, but every Mount Rushmore‚Äôs gotta have its Teddy Roosevelt: the ‚ÄúHim? Really?‚Äù wild card. (I get it, actually ‚Äî FDR didn‚Äôt become president until after Mount Rushmore was already under construction.) Fort Point‚Äôs Kolsch Style Ale is symbolic of the Bay Area today. No brewery here has grown at such rapid speed as Fort Point, which in its barely three years of existence has become relentlessly ubiquitous around town. KSA represents the moment we‚Äôre in right now: beer gone viral. Paolo Lucchesi, Chronicle food editor¬†  Anchor Steam. Yes. What Esther said.Lagunitas IPA. Even though Heineken owns half of the company these days, there must still be a spot reserved for Lagunitas (Laguneiken? Heinekinitas?). And given the city‚Äôs ongoing, fervent love affair with IPA, IPA still rules the city. So there needs to be one IPA on the list. Bear Republic‚Äôs Racer 5, Speakeasy‚Äôs Big Daddy and Lagunitas IPA all brought that beer style into our mainstream, but more importantly, they were part of the generation that really helped propel craft beer to the San Francisco masses ‚Äî not just fancy breweries, but normal corner bars. And in pure volume, Lagunitas still easily leads the way for all Northern California brewers not named Sierra.21st Amendment Hell Or High Watermelon. You can‚Äôt talk about Fort Point ‚Äî its whimsical branding, its smart cans, its easy-drinking beers ‚Äî without 21st Amendment. The SoMa (and now San Leandro) brewery rode the novelty of its watermelon wheat ale as it became a de facto summertime drink. It‚Äôs unique. It‚Äôs creative. It‚Äôs seasonal. It‚Äôs Bay Area. And there is no mistaking it, ever. You know what you‚Äôre drinking, and that logo design ‚Äî the Statue of Liberty lounging on the Golden Gate Bridge as she gazes wistfully into space ‚Äî is about as perfect as a modern beer label can get. Amid a tempest of hoppy beers and SERIOUS BEER PEOPLE, Hell or High Watermelon is a welcome reminder that beer should be fun, easy and light.Speakeasy Prohibition Ale. First, the contenders that missed the cut: Trumer Pilsner (too German), Fort Point (too new), either Pliny (not democratic enough), Sierra Nevada (not Bay Area enough), Sufferfest (not gluten enough), Magnolia (not one standout) and Oakland‚Äôs Linden Street (in transition to a new brand). I even tried to figure out how to get Hamm‚Äôs in here, in honor of the old sign by Seals Stadium. But Speakeasy Prohibition Ale is my pick. The amber ale was the Bayview brewery‚Äôs first beer and it still holds up. Readily available throughout the Bay Area, those Speakeasy sneaky eyes are a welcome sight on any tap. Maggie Hoffman, Bay Area beer writer¬†  Anchor Liberty Ale. Sure, Steam has been around much longer, but in 1975, Liberty was the beer that changed it all, that in many ways launched the identity of the hop head. Maybe some other small brewer would have come along to popularize dry-hopping with copious (for the time) quantities of Cascade hops and convinced us to embrace deliciously bitter beer ‚Äî the iconic Sierra Nevada Pale Ale arrived on the scene soon after ‚Äî but Anchor‚Äôs Liberty took that first step, and for that, we should be thankful. (Though Lagunitas IPA is a pretty good call, too.)Trumer Pils. We drink a ton of hoppy beer here in San Francisco, but we‚Äôre also partial to lighter thirst-quenchers, and we‚Äôre lucky to have such a widely available crisp and delicious example of pilsner brewed in Berkeley so we can drink it fresh. We take this gold medal-winning beer for granted way too often. (And thankfully, they‚Äôve finally started packaging it in cans, so you aren‚Äôt stuck drinking skunky green-bottle versions.)Moonlight Brewing Death and Taxes. Few people nationally would say black lager is their favorite style, but it‚Äôs second nature to San Franciscans to order this beer, which makes me proud to live here. I love that it‚Äôs rich in coffee-and-chocolate flavor but not at all heavy, and I love that it can be found on tap all around the Bay Area but not too far beyond. It‚Äôs ours, all ours.Russian River Brewing Consecration. This list would feel incomplete without a sour or wild-fermented beer ‚Äî many of the best local breweries today focus on tart, earthy, fruity brews made with the help of brettanomyces, lactobacillus and pediococcus. Russian River started brewing this delicious concoction in 2008, inspired by a deep, rich anniversary beer it brewed for Toronado‚Äôs 20th anniversary. Made with black currants and aged in Cabernet barrels, it brought together wine and beer, tannins and fruit, gathering so many flavors of the Bay Area together in one bottle. Owner-brewer Vinnie Cilurzo says he‚Äôs still drinking bottles from the original release; it makes me wonder which beers the Bay Area is producing today that will go the distance, and which new breweries will live to see another decade. Tim O‚ÄôRourke, Chronicle assistant managing editor  Anchor Steam. It‚Äôs the obvious choice for a reason: It‚Äôs been the signature San Francisco beer since before Mount Rushmore‚Äôs giant presidential heads were carved in South Dakota granite. Steam‚Äôs success paved the path for Anchor‚Äôs Liberty Ale and Jack McAuliffe‚Äôs New Albion Brewing, which inspired Ken Grossman and Sierra Nevada, which led to just about every one of the approximately 4,000 craft breweries producing excellent beers across the U.S. today.Russian River Brewing Pliny the Elder. What‚Äôs the most important measure of a beer? Its drinkability. This, however, isn‚Äôt only about pleasing the palate. More important, it‚Äôs about being able to find the beer and drink it when you‚Äôre thirsty. Pliny the Younger is the California cult craft beer, no doubt. But its double IPA Elder cousin is bottled and sold year-round across the region, and is available without standing in line with the tourists for five hours in the rain. Plus, at 8%, and with a blend of Amarillo, Centennial, CTZ and Simcoe hops, it‚Äôs smoother than the 10.25% Triple IPA hop bomb that draws the hordes to Russian River Brewing Co. every February. Hail to the Elder of the Plinys.Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA. Yes, we know. This list is getting a little hop heavy for the refined tastes of the Bay Area. Still, there‚Äôs no denying the region‚Äôs impact on the global interpretation of the indefatigable India pale ale, no matter how oversaturated the market. With apologies to Lagunitas, Drake‚Äôs, Fieldwork and Faction, Bear Republic‚Äôs standard-bearer has defined the floral-accented flavor profile of the Bay Area IPA better than any of its rivals.Almanac Saison Dolores. The Teddy Roosevelt pick could have gone a number of directions. Cellarmaker‚Äôs Coffee & Cigarettes porter might have cracked the top 4 if it were available year-round. The Rare Barrel‚Äôs ever-rotating list is a sour fiend‚Äôs dream, but it doesn‚Äôt help the Berkeley brewery scale Mount Rushmore. Outside the nine-county Bay Area, Sierra Nevada is the benchmark, with Sante Adairius in Capitola, Ruhstaller in Sacramento, Tahoe Mountain in Truckee, and Berryessa in Winters all making exciting, expectation-shattering brews outside the mainstream. The Bay Area‚Äôs most popular saison isn‚Äôt Almanac‚Äôs most ambitious offering, but it‚Äôs fruit-and-fermentation forward, does justice to the style and offers the masses a flavorful option outside the hop highway. Jonathan Kauffman, Chronicle reporter¬†  Anchor Steam. Refusing to put Anchor Steam on the Mount Rushmore of beers is like saying George Washington doesn‚Äôt deserve a 60-foot bust because he wasn‚Äôt as eloquent as Samuel Adams (no slight, Bostonian beers). Every city needs a house beer, and we‚Äôre lucky enough to have Anchor Steam. I do have to grumble that Anchor has chosen to trademark ‚Äústeam beer,‚Äù forcing a wave of younger breweries that also want to honor the Bay Area‚Äôs only native beer style to call it ‚ÄúCalifornia commons‚Äù instead of by its historic name.Russian River Brewing Consecration. I‚Äôm with Maggie on this one: Consecration is a stunning sour, with fruit and funk and tart all kept in balance, a wily corralling of wild yeasts. Compared with many of the sours that have come on the market since Consecration was first brewed, not to mention every brewery that thought sticking a beer in a wine keg for a few months would make it magic, Consecration gives lie to the assumption that progress is always chronologically forward. (Not you, Sante Adairius, Rare Barrel, Almanac, and Tahoe Mountain Brewing ‚Äî you‚Äôre doing some great work here.)North Coast Le Merle. First off, I think all Northern California is one beer ecosystem, not just the Bay Area. This 9-year-old farmhouse ale is my Teddy Roosevelt, whose release helped signal a countermovement in local brewing: food-friendly beers. Le Merle has the richness of a Belgian golden ale but with enough of a hop-sharpened edge to remind you it‚Äôs from the West Coast. You can see its legacy in the saison boom, but also in the work of younger breweries like Fort Point and Woodfour, which are focusing on beers that don‚Äôt demand you pay attention to them, but reward you when you do."
131.0,Food,"Named after the North of the Panhandle neighborhood in which it resides, Nopa gave rise to a modern dining boom.When the restaurant opened in a renovated bank space in 2006, Divisadero was not a destination for trendy dining it is today, but high-profile food businesses ‚Äî 4505 Meats, the Mill, Bi-Rite Market and national media darling Che Fico, to name a few ‚Äî have come to dominate the area.Amid it all, Nopa has remained a quintessential San Francisco restaurant that continues to attract both locals and tourists. Reservations are still tough to nab, thanks to a combination of a bustling yet welcoming atmosphere, a legion of regulars and reliable food.Chef-partner Laurence Jossel‚Äôs ultra-seasonal menu changes daily, but there are a few signatures that have come to define the restaurant. Carnivores fawn over the grilled pork chop and hamburger, the latter which some consider among the best in the city.But for those who want to go easy on meat ‚Äî or avoid it entirely ‚Äî there is Nopa‚Äôs Moroccan vegetable tagine, a longtime vegetarian menu staple.Essentially a vegetable stew, it‚Äôs the kind of hearty, flavorful and wholesome dish that‚Äôs perfect for keeping you warm and nourished during the chilly winter months that lie ahead.¬†Aquafab-ulous: The slightly viscous texture of the chickpea‚Äôs cooking liquid, also known as aquafaba, helps to create a luscious mouthfeel in the finished tagine.Flavorful foundation: Roasting the onions, fennel, carrots, potatoes and cauliflower separately in the hot cast-iron skillet allows the vegetables to cook at their own pace and help maintain their structural integrity. Adding each vegetable as it emerges hot from the oven to the rich saffron-spiked tomato base helps to build layer upon layer of flavor as the tagine cooks. Leaving the stew to sit overnight in the refrigerator allows those flavors to deepen further.Flexible finish: The base of the tagine remains the same throughout the year, but finishing the dish with a mix of whatever produce happens to be at its peak at the farmers‚Äô market helps to keep the dish fresh and seasonal.Pop of freshness: Garnishing the dish with a hearty dollop of lemony yogurt, along with the chopped mint and cilantro, adds a bright and fresh note to the finished dish.Make ahead: The tagine takes time, so you‚Äôll want to start the recipe the day before you plan to serve it. To save time, you can make the spice mixture in advance. (It will keep in an airtight container for up to a month.) The chickpeas can be made a day or two ahead and stored in their cooking liquid.Sarah Fritsche is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: sfritsche@sfchronicle.com.

122.0,Food,"At long last, wine growers in the Petaluma Gap area will be able to put ‚ÄúPetaluma Gap‚Äù on their wine labels, as the Petaluma Gap officially becomes California‚Äôs newest American Viticultural Area (AVA) on Friday, Dec. 8.The passage of the AVA, however, comes almost a year later than its stakeholders expected, delayed by bureaucratic shuffling in the new presidential administration.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a very long, frustrating road,‚Äù says Rickey Trombetta Stancliff, president of the Petaluma Gap Winegrowers Alliance and owner of Trombetta Family Wines.Rep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael, called the AVA‚Äôs passage ‚Äúlong overdue.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to have marketing and economic benefits for the communities I represent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you could also say that (wine) consumers will benefit, who haven‚Äôt had the benefit of an accurate designation for all these years.‚ÄùAVAs are government-designated boundaries for grape growing, and they affect how wine can be labeled. Grapes grown within the boundaries of the Napa Valley AVA, for example, can produce wines labeled as ‚ÄúNapa Valley.‚Äù The Petaluma Gap would be the 17th sub-AVA within Sonoma County, though its 203,000 acres ‚Äî from Tomales Bay to Sonoma Mountain ‚Äî encompass slivers of Marin County, too.Viticulturally speaking, it‚Äôs marked by its west-east wind pattern, which can result in wines with high acidity and high tannin, whose flavors can develop over a longer growing season.The original Petaluma Gap AVA petition was filed in early 2015, and moved through the pipeline relatively quickly; a public comment period ended last December, with no opposition. At that point, Stancliff believed, it was just a matter of a couple of quick signatures in Washington.‚ÄúWe thought, terrific, this won‚Äôt take very long,‚Äù Stancliff said.If only it had been so simple. In the final step before it can publish a new rule (as AVAs are classified) in the Federal Register, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) needs to obtain final approval from the Department of the Treasury. When President Donald Trump took office in January, several crucial positions at Treasury, whose signatures would have been necessary for the AVA passage, were left vacant.On Aug. 3, the U.S. Senate confirmed several of Trump‚Äôs nominees for Treasury positions, including Brent James McIntosh as general counsel and David Kautter as assistant secretary for tax policy. Four months later, the Petaluma Gap AVA rule was signed off.Many in the wine industry also feared that the executive order issued by Trump on Jan. 30, directing government agencies to repeal two regulations in order to pass one new regulation, would halt the passage of any new AVAs, which might have been interpreted as regulations themselves. Fortunately for Petaluma Gap producers, that did not seem to be a problem.‚ÄúStarting Dec. 8, we can start submitting our labels to the TTB for putting the Petaluma Gap AVA on our labels,‚Äù Stancliff said. This applies to any wines that have not yet been labeled, which could mean you‚Äôll be seeing wines from the 2014 vintage (or even, in some cases, earlier) labeled as Petaluma Gap.For small wine producers, being able to label a wine with the Petaluma Gap AVA could make a big difference. Such labeling helps with marketing, as it can communicate nuances to customers about vineyard qualities at a more precise level than a simple ‚ÄúSonoma County‚Äù or ‚ÄúSonoma Coast‚Äù label could. And it helps a region‚Äôs members communicate a coherent message about what makes their place special: One Petaluma Gap vintner‚Äôs success becomes every Petaluma Gap vintner‚Äôs success.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really significant,‚Äù Stancliff said. ‚ÄúNow instead of competing with a cast of thousands (in Sonoma County), we‚Äôre now down to a much smaller number, a more rarefied group.‚ÄúIt really helps a little brand like ours stand up and get noticed.‚Äù Esther Mobley is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs wine, beer and spirits writer.

54.0,Other,"Redfield is a good-looking new bar and bottle shop in Rockridge, with lots of natural light and just the right amount of indoor plants. It‚Äôs got exceedingly friendly service and a constantly rotating set of tap handles. It‚Äôs even right across the street from the Ramen Shop, making it the perfect way station for those who have put their name in for an hour-long wait.Sounds perfect. What could go wrong?Well, Redfield is a cider bar ‚Äî a category that‚Äôs still, even for many Bay Area gourmands, terra incognita. And Redfield‚Äôs owners, Olivia Maki and Mike Reis, know they‚Äôve got their work cut out for them.‚ÄúI would argue that the Bay Area‚Äôs cider scene is dramatically behind other cities when you consider the fact that this area really prides itself on food and beverage,‚Äù Reis says. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs nonexistent: We do have a cider bar in San Francisco, Upcider, and a handful of good local cider producers from Sonoma County to Santa Cruz. But, Reis says, when you compare us with Seattle or Chicago or Brooklyn, we‚Äôre not even in the same league.Perpetually in the shadow of its fermented-beverage counterparts, cider has yet to break free of the chains of wine and beer comparisons. For some beer drinkers, cider is too funky; for some wine lovers, it lacks structure. Both categories of people tend to believe, mistakenly, that it‚Äôs always sweet. It‚Äôs an afterthought on most restaurants‚Äô drink lists, an obligatory entry for the would-be beer drinker who can‚Äôt consume gluten.Maybe Redfield can start to change that.Maki and Reis came to cider, as they hope many of their customers will, from other corners of the food and beverage world. The couple met while collaborating on an event for the 18 Reasons cooking school, where Maki was working at the time; Reis, an advanced Cicerone (beer sommelier), was the beverage director for Monk‚Äôs Kettle and the now-closed Abbot‚Äôs Cellar. Together, their love for cider bloomed, as they visited cideries around the country and began pressing some apples themselves in their Berkeley backyard.The couple understood that opening a cider bar would be an uphill battle. That‚Äôs why they sought out a spot with good foot traffic: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt ask people to go out of their way to experience cider,‚Äù Reis says, ‚Äúbecause not a lot of people know that cider is something they‚Äôll like.‚Äù College Avenue, near the Rockridge BART Station, fit the bill.Reis and Maki are doing everything right. They are deeply knowledgeable and infectiously passionate about their subject. They have a manner of speaking about cider that immediately puts you at ease. (Listen to their podcast, Redfield Radio, and you‚Äôll know what I mean.) Recognizing that cider has gained momentum among the gluten-free set, for whom beer is off-limits, they offer a menu of mostly gluten-free snacks ‚Äî including Oyna Natural Foods‚Äô very tasty kukus, an Iranian egg dish.The Redfield cider selection, which consists of 10 tap handles, five glass pours and 125 bottles, is remarkably diverse, encompassing everything from bacterial, bone-dry Asturian sidra (try the Fanjul Cidra Natural, $7.50/6 ounces) to jammy, slightly sweet ciders loaded with fruits (try the Cherry Seinfeld from San Leandro‚Äôs Hidden Star, $6.50/16 ounces) to boundary-pushing modern experiments (try Sin Eater‚Äôs hopped cider, $7.50/10 ounces).In other words, they‚Äôre making it easy for you. But for a category so maligned and misunderstood, is that enough?‚ÄúBy far, the most common misconception we encounter is that all cider is sweet,‚Äù Reis says. And the cider industry isn‚Äôt exactly helping to demystify that. Lots of sweet ciders are mislabeled as dry, while many actually dry ciders might be perceived as sweet, simply because they‚Äôre exuberantly fruity. Reis and Maki have to spend a lot of time reassuring customers that they‚Äôre not going to be pouring them something that tastes like Martinelli‚Äôs apple juice. (They do, however, offer Martinelli‚Äôs as a nonalcoholic option, as well as Bernie‚Äôs Best. This is a kid-friendly establishment.)For now, the message seems to be working. There‚Äôs no Ramen Shop-level line at Redfield, but the small bar has been drawing crowds in the late afternoons and evenings. And although a smart selection of craft beers and local wines are available, almost everyone has a glass ‚Äî or, more likely, a flight ‚Äî of cider in front of them, much to the owners‚Äô delight.‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have people going into City Beer Store or Bay Grape being like, ‚ÄòLemme get a Coors‚Äô or they‚Äôre looking for a bottle of Barefoot,‚Äù Reis laughs on the second episode of the podcast. But he and Maki recognize that many would-be cider aficionados are still in the Barefoot stage of their development, and they‚Äôre careful not to condescend.At the other end of the spectrum, some drinkers are looking for funkier ciders ‚Äî a profile in line with the increasingly popular cadre of sour beers and natural wines. Redfield can deliver there, too, with ciders like the Guzman Riestra Brut Nature ($11/6 ounces), a Champagne-method Spanish number that‚Äôs crisp and fruity and lightly touched by barnyard ‚Äî a small leap for someone accustomed to drinking orange wines or saisons.And it‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone ‚Äî whether you drink off-dry Rieslings or hoppy IPAs or anything in between ‚Äî disliking something like the Eve‚Äôs Cidery Darling Creek, from New York ($11/6 ounces), a rich, honeyed, beautifully textured cider, also made in the Champagne method. It‚Äôs as bracing as a great beer and as layered as a great wine.Or maybe that‚Äôs the wrong way to describe a cider. Which brings us to the other great challenge that Redfield faces: how to talk about this beverage without becoming mired in imperfect comparisons with wine and beer? Many of the considerations, like tannin, acidity and fermentation techniques, are parallel. Others are not. For example, many apple varieties aren‚Äôt suitable for creating a single-variety cider, the way Chardonnay or Merlot would be showcased alone in a varietal wine, or Simcoe or Mosaic hops in a single-hop beer.One apple that does lend itself to a single-variety cider, though, is the bar‚Äôs namesake ‚Äî the Redfield, a tannic, deeply flavored apple variety with dark red flesh. If it‚Äôs available by the glass, the Redfield from West County ($8/6 ounces) is a must-order. West County is a cidery in western Massachusetts that‚Äôs been a leading U.S. producer since the 1980s; Reis calls it ‚Äúthe Anchor Brewing of the cider world.‚ÄùThere we go with the comparisons again.To order: Eve‚Äôs Darling Creek ($11/6 ounces), Eric Bordelet Poire Granit 2016 ($12/6 ounces), West County Redfield ($8/6 ounces), Hidden Star Cherry Seinfeld ($6.50/16 ounces), potato kuku ($15)Where: Redfield Cider Bar and Bottle Shop, 5815 College Ave., Oakland. 510-250-9058 www.redfieldcider.comWhen: Noon to 11 p.m. Sun-Thurs, until midnight Fri-Sat.Ultimately, Maki and Reis recognize that the Bay Area probably isn‚Äôt quite ready to move cider out of the wine and beer shadow. ‚ÄúLong-term it would be great to see cider develop its own language and vocabulary,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll start to get there in, like, a year. For now our goal is just to make cider as approachable as possible.‚ÄùHey, if talking wine and beer is what it takes to get someone in the Redfield door, so be it. Because Maki and Reis believe once people taste some really good cider, they‚Äôll be easily converted. The hardest part is getting it in their glasses."
99.0,Food,"It has been a pivotal year for both the restaurant industry and the journalists who cover it. While dozens of high-profile investigations uncovered harassment, wage theft and other abuse in the food world, American restaurant criticism also took a notable shift.Nyum Bai, a humble Cambodian noodle shop in Oakland run by first-time restaurateur Nite Yun, was the Bay Area‚Äôs most decorated restaurant. Yun started the year as a Chronicle Rising Star and was then celebrated by national media outlets like the New York Times, Bon Appetit and Eater, among others. Usually, restaurants that snag such praise are high-end spots, not those with prices under $20.When we looked at our favorite restaurants of the year, we saw more singularity with creative pasta, mezze platters and pozole verde than with rote tasting menus and tweezer food. That‚Äôs not to say high-end dining is absent ‚Äî two of the most expensive new spots in Palo Alto and San Francisco made our list ‚Äî but there‚Äôs certainly a wider range across the spectrum of price, accessibility and culture.To me, there‚Äôs a similarity here to the music world‚Äôs poptimism movement of the early 2000s. In 2004, New York Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh penned an influential piece arguing that pop music ‚Äî be it country or hip-hop ‚Äî deserved the same critical respect (and hence, ink) as the rock genre that had dominated the discourse for decades.In a similar sense, so much (though not all!) of mainstream food media has been traditionally focused on upscale dining. This is changing, and it‚Äôs time to afford the same respect to all genres.‚Äî Paolo Lucchesi, plucchesi@sfchronicle Nyum BaiNite Yun opened Nyum Bai in Fruitvale simply hoping it would draw the same crowds it did when it was a pop-up in the Mission three years ago.

Lunch and dinner Tue.-Sat.; and noon-8 p.m. Sun.Yuanbao JiaoziIf you spend a lot of time in Bay Area Chinese restaurants, you‚Äôve probably noticed that the 2010s have been the decade of the dumpling: It‚Äôs impossible to count, let alone visit, all the tiny shops that have appeared with short menus of boiled Northern Chinese dumplings, hand-pulled noodles and small, cold dishes. With most of these places, a good line of communication between you and the waiter is essential, or you‚Äôll never know which dumplings the cooks are furiously folding as you sit there and which will be pulled out from the freezer and dumped in hot water. Yuanbao Jiaozi doesn‚Äôt just introduce San Franciscans to dumpling flavors from the far northeast of China ‚Äî the fish and green pepper and pork with three flavors are particularly delicious ‚Äî it recognizes that the crew of white-aproned cooks stuffing dumplings to order yields smoother, more tender wrappers and fillings with prismatic flavors. ‚Äî Jonathan Kauffman2110 Irving St., San Francisco. 415-702-6506.

In an era where the same hamachi crudo starters and grilled shishito peppers seem to proliferate on every menu, Angler represents the rare restaurant that truly serves original, beautiful and genre-defining dishes. Seafood is billed as the specialty, but it‚Äôs the fire-kissed vegetable dishes, like the embered tomatoes or XO radicchio, that truly break the mold.

Subsequently, so have the black-owned businesses. Meanwhile, stalwarts like Foster have found the climate increasingly difficult, evident in Foster‚Äôs Farmerbrown closing in the Tenderloin.

141.0,Other,"At B. Patisserie, Belinda Leong, Michel Suas and their team captivate mobs of local regulars and far-flung visitors with cakes, tarts, laminated pastries, cookies and breads stacked on a long marble counter in their James Beard Award-winning Pacific Heights shop.A tired food-writing truism often lurks in the discussion around high-profile bakeries like B. Patisserie: savory cooking is an art, but baking is a science. Physics, chemistry and biology have ruled everything we have ever eaten since before we invented kitchens, and savory cooking is no different from baking in its intimate dependence on science. Whether a baker fits the mold of Suas, an analytically minded technician, or Leong, a self-taught virtuoso who seldom measures anything, the principles that differentiate their craft from that of line cooks and savory chefs are not scientific; they‚Äôre architectural.Bakers and pastry chefs mix dough, temper chocolate and pull sugar to mold carbs, sugars, proteins and fats into solid, three-dimensional objects. Savory cooking typically focuses on preserving, destroying or remodeling the prefabricated bricks and mortar of animal and plant cells; baking requires erecting new structures from scratch.Leong and Suas combine the sensitivity of prodding hands with the consistency of precision techniques to lead their talented crew in constructing delicious cathedrals from shapeless powders, pastes and liquids. Here are the blueprints they‚Äôve created for three of their landmark offerings.GranolaToast rolled purple wheat and oats, mix with sliced almonds, puffed kamut and crispy rice. Mix maple syrup, brown sugar, AP flour, butter and salt to form a paste. Combine with grains. Bake on trays to form molten caramel coating, break into clusters and continue baking to solidify sugar glass. Serve.Crispiness and crunchiness emerge from tangled mishmashes of sugar, carbs or proteins dehydrated to form an inflexible glass. These locked-up structures are too brittle to bend, so they fracture when bitten. Crispiness is the sensation of cracking a thin layer of one of these edible glasses. Crunchiness is the chaos that happens when our teeth crash through a stack of crispy layers. The 3-D topography of B. Patisserie‚Äôs granola spans both ends of this shattering spectrum, plus the gray area between.Leong fashions her granola from three types of crispy brick. Rolled oats and flakes of purple wheat (a unique, brightly colored cultivar which Suas sources from northern Canada) are steamed and pressed flat before drying. This pretreatment tenderizes the grains, prepping them for transformation into tiny, brittle shingles when toasted to drive off any lingering moisture. Thinly sliced almonds mirror the shape of the flattened grains but provide a sturdier snap derived from their natural concrete of oils bound in equal parts starch and protein. Puffed rice and kamut guard refreshing pockets of empty space in the tiny atriums contained within their thin, flash-set walls. This combination keeps our teeth guessing and our brains engaged.For binding the nuts and grains together, Leong alloys maple syrup, brown sugar and butter with AP flour into a reinforced syrup. When baked, this mixture cascades molten treacle across the landscape, forming crunchy caverns, shelves and crusts studded with captured crispy bits.The easiest way to make clustered granola is to smash fully baked and cooled slabs into smaller pieces. While efficient, this approach breaks and crumbles the delicate globes and flakes of nut and grain in jagged rifts over random fault lines.To avoid setting off half of the textural fireworks before anyone can appreciate the show, Leong instead forms the clusters when the binder is 75 percent cooked and still pliable. This technique requires handling superheated maple lava, but it allows the clusters to break in tailored silhouettes around each grain or nut, preserving their explosive payload for the moment you bite down.BostockMix flour, fresh cake yeast, milk, salt and sugar to form dough. Add cubed, cold butter and mix to incorporate. Fold dough on flat surface, rest on sheet tray for 45 minutes. Repeat twice. Ferment overnight. Portion and shape dough balls, proof in mousseline pans lined with parchment. Bake. Age overnight. Slice loaves into 2-inch medallions. Dip into syrup of sugar, water and passion fruit puree. Place on silpat-lined baking sheet, top with piped almond cream (butter, sugar, cornstarch, egg and almond flour) and sliced almonds. Bake. Serve.Innovations in building materials made modern towers lighter, but savvy design and engineering were also key in sending the first skyscrapers upward. Leong and Suas push their carefully tested and refined recipes to greater heights by tinkering with the geometry of everything on their menu.Brioche mousseline, a riff on the more conventional sandwich-style loaf, involves baking the buttery dough in an upright metal tube to form a silo of delicate crumb surrounded by brown walls of crispy crust. Mousseline molds range in shape, size and price point, from gleaming French-made gear to old coffee cans. These differences aren‚Äôt just aesthetic; the diameter and height of the container walls affect how a recipe will perform, just like the elevated bars and rings that facilitate an Olympic gymnastics routine.Leong and Suas use a particularly narrow-diameter mousseline mold to give evaporating water in the dough one direction to expand when baked: up. In a wider mold, B. Patisserie‚Äôs tissue-soft brioche dough would collapse in the center as soon as the buoyant force of hot steam dissipates out of the oven. Instead, the narrow walls of their preferred molds conduct searing heat straight to the sides of the loaf as it climbs, cauterizing a rigid brown crust that provides enough structural support to keep the moist interior stretched tight as a drum.Bostocks first evolved as a French toast-style method of repurposing day-old bread by rehydrating stale brioche in flavorful syrup before baking it back to life. While the B. Patisserie bakers make their brioche mousseline exclusively for this purpose, they still allow the baked loaves to age one day. Overnight, the starch lining the honeycomb walls of the crumb crystallizes, building up durable levees to withstand the flood of syrup to come.Every morning, a B. Patisserie cook cuts each aged brioche loaf into 2-inch medallions to be dipped in a syrup flavored with passion fruit or orange blossom, depending on the season. Leong developed a dipping protocol that her staff practices with the reverence of Indiana Jones dipping a chalice at the end of ‚ÄúThe Last Crusade.‚Äù She teaches her cooks to feel for the proper trickle of excess syrup filtering down through the bottom of each cake through gloved hands. Temperature plays a role in the process as well. Syrup that is too cold will lack the agility that it needs to enter and saturate every hidden corner of the medallion. Overheated syrup drips off before it can find a place to cling.Leong seals each perfectly hydrated cylinder with a lid of almond cream. The piped cream forms an edible closure that keeps the interior moist while the outer ring of crust receives an extra spackling of blistering heat during a second turn through the oven.This is the seared filet mignon of the pastry world.Kouign amannMix water, flour, milk, salt and fresh cake yeast. Rest one hour, roll flat, add butter, fold. Repeat folding and resting twice more. Dust with sugar, portion dough and shape into six-sided rosettes. Bake in ring molds. For chocolate and fruit versions, pipe ganache or coulis into center after baking. Serve.Back when Earth was an embryonic chowder of simple chemicals and water, the first cells achieved true life in part by building fatty barriers to separate themselves from their environment. By enrobing itself in a thin layer of lipids, each individual cell gained the power to choose which water-borne nutrients, toxins, friends and foes would be welcomed or denied entry. Laminated pastries like croissants and B. Patisserie‚Äôs iconic kouign amann are possible because of a chemical pattern that facilitates life on Earth.Water allows starch and gluten to snake around in any direction, forming some of the stickiest edible substances we have. Fat is a glossy force field through which water cannot pass, so any molecules trying to surf watery waves are also denied transit. When dispersed evenly throughout a doughy network of gluten and carbs, bakers use fat like a dimmer switch to slide along a continuum of dough textures from chewy to crumbly. Laminated doughs compress the chewy resilience of a lean, lightly sweetened dough into two-dimensional sheets, stacking layers of solid fat between them to provide a more dynamic form of tenderness.The perfectly separated concentric circles seen in the dramatic cross sections of Instagram‚Äôs favorite croissants require extremely stiff dough. Tougher dough sheets prevent tears and flaws that would allow starch and protein in adjacent layers to high-five and glom together. Leong and Suas prefer a softer, more delicate dough, choosing to transmit visions of ecstatic texture into their customers‚Äô minds through tongues rather than phones.Working with B. Patisserie‚Äôs especially silky dough necessitates a tightrope act of butter management. Melted butter can escape into the pores of the dough and transform it into a crumbly block of pie crust, and butter that is too cold will shred tender dough, like an iceberg scraping the hull of a ship. To keep the butter within the correct, wire-thin temperature window, B. Patisserie bakers learn an intimate choreography that alternates between bear-hugging a parchment-swaddled baton of dough to warm it with gentle body heat and rushing it into refrigeration to rest and recuperate after each round of folding.Physical agitation winds gluten like the springs of a clock to make dough firmer and more elastic. The repetitive folding and flattening required to make laminated layers excites these springs as though they were being kneaded, so Leong and Suas take care to start the process with dough even softer than their target texture.Water embedded in each dough layer lies coiled and ready to expand with the heat of the oven, and butter gives each layer something to push off from without sticking to the layer below. B. Patisserie gives the expanding volcanoes of water a head start by carving out cavernous bubbles within the dough prior to baking, through the fermentative action of yeast.After three rounds of folding, each dough slab receives a generous dusting of sugar. The sugared slabs are then cut into individual portions that B. Patisserie bakers fold into six-sided roses in stainless steel baking cups.In the oven, the sugary crust drapes a lacquered cape across each petal of the blossoming pastry. A few rivulets of molten sugar trickle downward to escape the dry heat of oven air, leaving a spoonful of sticky syrup at the center of each pastry.Crispy and chewy are an iconic culinary duo, but their chemical relationship is more toxic than the protagonists in a vampire-human love story. The corruptive influence of its moist interior will turn each pastry‚Äôs glassy, crispy shell back to caramel within hours.This war of attrition means that B. Patisserie kouign amanns have a short shelf life, but during those precious few hours immediately after baking, they shimmer and stand tall like a Frank Gehry-designed croissant with a creme brulee skylight.

62.0,Food,"California, according to Kevin Harvey, has never gotten Italian-inspired wines quite right. He plans to change that.‚ÄúSo many Cal-Ital projects have failed,‚Äù the vintner says. ‚ÄúAt the low end, it‚Äôs not differentiated from the available cheap Italian wines. At the high end, nobody‚Äôs really tried.‚Äù(No doubt many California producers of Italian-style wines ‚Äî Massican, Idlewild, Villa Creek, Bella Luna, Giornata, Palmina and Castelli among them ‚Äî would take issue with this statement, but Harvey‚Äôs sticking to it.)Harvey is not an obvious candidate for a Cal-Ital revival. In the last decade he‚Äôs become a hero to the Burgundy-worshipping set, thanks to the ethereal Pinot Noirs he makes under his Rhys Vineyards label in the Santa Cruz Mountains ‚Äî the result of rigorous geological study and meticulous vineyard plantings. The Rhys Pinots have attracted an eager waiting list of customers and rhapsodic reviews from critics. ‚ÄúThe wines aren‚Äôt just great; they‚Äôre significant,‚Äù wrote former Chronicle wine editor Jon Bonne of Rhys in 2011.So Harvey‚Äôs launching of his new Italian-inspired wine label, Aeris (Latin for ‚Äúair‚Äù), comes with some built-in gravitas. And the vineyard he has planted for Aeris, which he‚Äôs calling Centennial Mountain Vineyard, is as ambitious as any of the Rhys sites, high on a remote coastal ridgetop west of Lake Sonoma.Like Rhys, Aeris is not a corner-cutting operation. When Harvey wants to make a new wine, he plants a new vineyard. (A successful career in Silicon Valley ‚Äî he founded the venture capital firm Benchmark ‚Äî helps to fund these developments.) He rarely lands in tried-and-true wine regions. Relentless curiosity has led Harvey to vertiginous slopes along the San Andreas Fault line, to the deep end of the Anderson Valley, to the hills above Gilroy. (The latter, called the Mt. Pajaro Vineyard, has Chenin Blanc and Riesling planted.) Harvey‚Äôs approach to viticulture is empirical and data-driven; the man is obsessed with spreadsheets. He‚Äôs been working on a magnum opus spreadsheet, which compares historical weather data among different wine regions ‚Äî informing Harvey‚Äôs decisions of where to plant what ‚Äî for 15 years.Like so many Burgundy lovers, Kevin Harvey is also a Piedmont fanatic. That‚Äôs why Nebbiolo, the grape that comprises the great red wines of Barolo and Barbaresco, is a central focus of Aeris. The other focus, perhaps improbably, is Carricante, a white grape variety from Sicily. The grapes Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Capuccio, Barbera, Primitivo and Zinfandel are also planted at Centennial Mountain.‚ÄúIf Carricante is as successful in California as I think it could be,‚Äù Harvey says, ‚Äúthis could be a key grape for unlocking some of California‚Äôs climates that are too warm for Chardonnay.‚ÄùChances are, you‚Äôve never tasted a Carricante wine. Even in its home of Sicily it‚Äôs sparsely planted ‚Äî just 361 acres (out of about 312,000 on the island) as of 2013. In California, forget it. The U.S. Department of Agriculture doesn‚Äôt even list the grape in its 2017 crop acreage report.Yet Harvey believes that Carricante, if grown in the right places and vinified in the right ways, has the potential to be one of the great white wines of the world ‚Äî maybe the great white wine. Carricante can achieve huge flavor at low alcohol levels, detonate with aromatic complexity and taste like citrus, orange blossoms, fennel, honey. It‚Äôs often relentlessly sea-salty, with the kind of searing acid you‚Äôd expect from fine Riesling.It may be the best white wine you‚Äôve never tasted.Harvey‚Äôs Carricante revelation came in a bottle of 2001 Benanti Pietramarina, from the Etna Bianco Superiore appellation, tasted on a trip to Italy. ‚ÄúIt was like grand cru white Burgundy,‚Äù Harvey recalls. ‚ÄúOr maybe more like (the Alsatian Riesling) Clos Saint Hune ‚Äî the aromatics, the complexity. I was fascinated by it.‚ÄùIn addition to the Centennial Mountain plantings, Harvey also went in on a Carricante vineyard in Sicily with Salvo Foti, the winemaker behind that fateful Pietramarina. From that vineyard, too, he‚Äôs making a Carricante wine under the Aeris label, to be released in 2018 ‚Äî the first of the Aeris wines available for purchase.As for Nebbiolo, Harvey‚Äôs is hardly the first attempt. California producers like Giornata, Palmina and Castelli have staked identities on the grape, often to great acclaim. But there are deep misconceptions about the appropriate growing conditions for Nebbiolo, Harvey says: specifically, that Nebbiolo thrives in Piedmont because of that region‚Äôs limestone soils and its cool climate.But not all of Piedmont has limestone ‚Äî the Gattinara area, for instance, is all schist. And Harvey dismisses the cool-climate myth outright. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs these assumptions that Piemonte is so cold, and all of California is like the Mojave Desert,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNebbiolo actually needs heat.‚Äù Nebbiolo requires just as much heat accumulation as Grenache, a famously heat-loving grape, he claims, though it requires that heat over a longer growing season. In 2007, he planted Nebbiolo vines at his Horseshoe Vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and it wasn‚Äôt hot enough: ‚ÄúThe grapes didn‚Äôt even turn red.‚ÄùWhat Nebbiolo wants, Harvey decided, is a relatively low diurnal shift: cooler days and warmer nights ‚Äî the opposite of what you‚Äôll find in most of California. Although California wine regions are often praised precisely for their high daily temperature variations, Nebbiolo needs the lower diurnal, Harvey says, ‚Äúso that you‚Äôre not burning off complex aromatics during the day.‚ÄùAfter abandoning the grape at Horseshoe, Harvey determined a set of characteristics he would need for a successful Nebbiolo site: somewhere with high heat accumulation and a low diurnal shift, schist-based soils, about 15 miles from the ocean, at an altitude of at least 2,000 feet. Centennial Mountain, perched on this ridgetop outside of Dry Creek Valley, checked all the boxes. In 2012 he planted 25 acres of grapevines here.Sitting at a picnic table overlooking the Centennial Mountain Vineyard, I taste a few cask samples of the Aeris wines with Harvey, winemaker Jeff Brinkman and vineyard manager Javier Tapia. A 2016 Nerello Capuccio ‚Äî a red grape used in Etna Rosso wines ‚Äî is velvety, fresh and dewy, concentrated but not excessively tannic. A 2016 Zinfandel (the vineyard‚Äôs outlier grape, maybe, though a traditionally safe bet in this part of Sonoma) is gorgeous already, but still primary ‚Äî structured, woodsy and floral, its strawberry-tinged fruit lifted by fresh acidity.The 2016 Nebbiolo is closed right now, reticent. It‚Äôs light, the color of brick and rough with tannins ‚Äî not nearly as much tannin, still, as young Piedmont wines. It shows typical Nebbiolo characters of terra-cotta, sanguinity, cherry and anise. I find it promising. Harvey isn‚Äôt satisfied. He won‚Äôt be releasing any of these 2016s: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got one chance to make a first impression,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo if we err, we‚Äôll err on the side of not releasing.‚ÄùCommercially, Harvey concedes Aeris is a risky move. ‚ÄúThis whole project is probably unviable,‚Äù he says,‚Äù except that we might be able to succeed if just 20 percent of our Rhys customer base buys.‚Äù But will they buy just one bottle of Nebbiolo and Carricante, then return to the more familiar Rhys Pinots and Chardonnays? That‚Äôs his fear. (The Aeris wines will cost between $39 and $59 per bottle.)Still, there will be one Aeris wine released in 2018: the 2014 Aeris Etna Bianco Superiore from Sicily, from the vineyard partnership with Salvo Foti. The wine is ‚Äúvery close to 100 percent‚Äù Carricante, Harvey says. That‚Äôs crucial. True Carricante ‚Äî as opposed to the Etna Biancos commonly diluted with simpler, blander grapes ‚Äî is the sort of stuff that induces revelations. It did for Harvey, and it did for me.Will the 2014 Aeris Etna Bianco Superiore be the best white wine you‚Äôll ever taste? I won‚Äôt go that far. Yet it‚Äôs an unquestionably delicious wine. Salty, yes, and explosively aromatic, it shows both a diesel oil note like you‚Äôd expect from Riesling and a lanolin note like you‚Äôd expect from Chenin Blanc. It will be the most unusual wine you‚Äôve tasted in a long time. Depending on the week, it could easily be the best white wine you drink that week. Until, that is, you get your hands on an aged bottle of Foti‚Äôs Pietramarina."
33.0,US & World,"MUNICH (AP) ‚Äî The Latest on the international security conference taking place in Munich (all times local):1 p.m.A senior Chinese official is signaling that Beijing isn't interested in joining an expanded version of the Cold War-era nuclear weapons treaty between the United States and Russia that Washington and Moscow have decided to abandon.The U.S. announced this month that it was pulling out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty because of Russian violations.

Or do we help it more by keeping the small anchor we have in order maybe to exert pressure in other areas?""___11:45 a.m.Egypt's president has called on Western countries to boost efforts at tackling extremist ideology in online media and mosques.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference Saturday, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi says countries must ""tackle websites that are inciting hatred and spreading extremist and terrorist narratives among communities in the Islamic world and in the West.""He also said authorities should ""be very mindful of what is being promoted at houses of worship,"" adding that extremists should not be allowed to preach. He underlined his efforts in Egypt to control the sermons in mosques.Egypt has wide-ranging restrictions on free speech.El-Sissi also mentioned that in the terrorism context, the failure to reach a fair and final settlement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents the main source of instability in the Middle East.___11:15 a.m.German Chancellor Angela Merkel is calling on China to join international disarmament negotiations after the collapse of a Cold War-era treaty on nuclear weapons in Europe.The U.S. earlier this month announced that it was pulling out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, accusing Russia of violating it.

112.0,Food,"Maybe, in another time or another place, the bar at the Hotel Kabuki would have been a standout.It‚Äôs a beautiful space, with its brightly lit backbar showing off illuminated bottles and clusters of big, comfy couches ‚Äî the kind you can sink into. An extension of the lobby, the bar ought to look good: It‚Äôs the result of a $31 million remodel, reopened early this year.And the drinks menu, at least at first glance, is ambitious. (Stephanie Ann Wheeler, who formerly worked at Boston‚Äôs Verb Hotel and Chicago bar Three Dots and a Dash, is the bar manager.) Divided into eight  sections, it checks all the trend boxes: a page of spirits produced by ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù or industry colleagues; a Japanese whiskey list; an entire page of highballs. Miso appears twice. On-trend bonus points for the half-dozen or more seriously obscure cocktail ingredients, like umeboshi (pickled plums) and ‚Äúbamboo ash.‚ÄùSo it came as a surprise, when I visited the bar at the Hotel Kabuki, that many of the drinks on this far-reaching menu fell flat.The golden milk tea ($22), from the Tea for Two section of the menu, arrives in a gorgeous, patterned teapot with little ceramic teacups, all set atop a wooden board. The presentation looks a whole lot better than it tastes. Served warm, the gin-based concoction is sweet and thick from coconut cream and vanilla, and its saccharine flavors do not integrate with the boozy heat of the gin. Turmeric and matcha, savory notes that could have grounded the drink, are not discernible. I might have created a similar-tasting concoction in my college dorm room, if I‚Äôd wanted to spike some milk tea.Excessive sweetness is a common theme. The chrysanthemum ($13), from the Light Bright and Citrusy chapter, reads as austere (Kikori whiskey, chrysanthemum, jasmine tea, lemon) but tastes like Kool-Aid, its punchy sweetness left unchallenged. Once again, though, the vessel is clever: a porcelain cat with a straw sticking out by one ear and a purple flower wedged in an opening in its back.High points include the sakura ($13), which has a lemon rind cut into the shape of a flower floating on its egg-white top and shows a pleasant contrast of textures. Still, though, the gin- and whiskey-based cocktail is dominated by a perfume-like herbal note, thanks to a hibiscus tea syrup, recalling a little too strongly a Crabtree & Evelyn store.When cocktails do work at the Kabuki bar, they still, for the most part, fail to feel special. Like the montsuki ($14), a boozy number with mezcal, Tequila, chartreuse, apple brandy, Sherry and bitters: Herbal and spicy, it passes muster, but at $14 in 2018 San Francisco, shouldn‚Äôt it wow?After all, hotel bars aren‚Äôt what they used to be. The bar, so to speak, has been raised. In San Francisco, we‚Äôve got Raul Ayala making inventive drinks (including, speaking of miso, an excellent miso-laced horchata) at the Hotel Zelos bar, Dirty Habit. At Parallel 37 at the Ritz-Carlton, Camber Lay has crafted a list that would be accessible to any martini-drinking business-class traveler, but adds creative inflection points. In the Tilden Hotel, the Douglas Room ‚Äî run by Brian Felley and Mo Hodges of Benjamin Cooper ‚Äî gave me one of my most memorable cocktails of 2017, a mezcal concoction with roasted corn called the Elote.Among last year‚Äôs highest-profile bar openings was Charmaine‚Äôs, the provocative effort from Josh Harris and Morgan Schick of Trick Dog, atop the Proper Hotel. And in fact, one of our city‚Äôs most brilliant barmen, Kevin Diedrich of Pacific Cocktail Haven, built much of his career in hotel bars: Burritt Room (Mystic Hotel), Jasper‚Äôs (Serrano Hotel) and BDK (Hotel Monaco).All of those bartenders ‚Äî Ayala, Lay, Felley, Hodges, Diedrich, Harris and Schick ‚Äî are former Chronicle Bar Stars. Which means that San Francisco‚Äôs hotel bars have some of the best local talent in the business.So why pay $13 or more for a subpar cocktail in a hotel lobby?Esther Mobley is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs wine, beer and spirits writer.

98.0,Food,"New Belgium Brewing Company of Fort Collins, Colo., has agreed to purchase the assets of San Francisco‚Äôs Magnolia Brewing out of bankruptcy for $2.7 million.Magnolia founder Dave McLean filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2015. Since then, his two San Francisco breweries have remained open, but the future of the 20-year-old company remained unclear.‚ÄúDave and Magnolia are great friends of ours,‚Äù New Belgium founder Kim Jordan said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre venerable in San Francisco and have a lot of heritage.‚ÄùCiting the recent sale of San Francisco‚Äôs Anchor Brewing to Japanese brewery Sapporo, Jordan said: ‚ÄúI just think it‚Äôs a really sweet opportunity for Dave, for us, and for the craft brewing community to do something like this.‚ÄùMagnolia‚Äôs two brewpubs will remain open for business. Jordan said she‚Äôs not sure whether the new owners will seek to increase production. The current capacity of Magnolia‚Äôs Dogpatch brewery is 30 barrels, and the Haight brewery‚Äôs a mere 7 barrels.New Belgium, meanwhile, produces about 1 million barrels annually, as of this year. Perhaps best known for its Fat Tire ale, the company has breweries in Colorado and Asheville, N.C., though Jordan ‚Äî who lives part-time in San Francisco ‚Äî said she has long considered a permanent move to California. The Brewers Association defines craft breweries as those that produce under 6 million barrels per year. New Belgium is 100 percent employee owned, Jordan said.Dick Cantwell, founder of Elysian Brewing, a Seattle craft brewer acquired by AB InBev in 2015, will join as Magnolia‚Äôs new head brewer. He will work alongside McLean, who now becomes a Magnolia employee, to oversee brewing. Belgian brewery Oud Beersel, known for its lambic beers, has also been named a partner in this deal. The goal, said New Belgium‚Äôs Bryan Simpson, is that Oud Beersel could eventually collaborate with Cantwell and McLean on spontaneously fermented beers under the Magnolia label.Jordan said she‚Äôs not counting out more acquisitions by New Belgium, though they might wait a bit. ‚ÄúWe think we‚Äôll spend at least a little time savoring this and enjoying it,‚Äù she added.

110.0,Food,"Italian food is so integral to Bay Area dining culture that it‚Äôs difficult to imagine it having ebbs and flows. Yet Emilio Mitidieri says local interest in house-made pasta is at a high point, the fifth in his career as a purveyor of professional pasta machines and other Italian tools.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt keep up,‚Äù he says of the demand for the latest, fastest, most expensive pasta making machines from chefs not only in San Francisco, but in Montreal, New York and Mexico City. ‚ÄúBecause of media influence, everybody is looking at what everybody‚Äôs doing. Instagram is really important.‚ÄùOwner of EmilioMiti, which has a showroom in the Mission, Mitidieri has been in the pasta-maker import business since 1979 in San Francisco, where he has watched handmade pasta trends go through 10-year cycles. He attributes the current peak partly to the excitement around the Italian food emporium Eataly, which has five U.S. locations. It‚Äôs also due to an ongoing passion for making things ‚Äî for example, at San Francisco‚Äôs A Mano, which means ‚Äúby hand‚Äù in Italian, which has three different pasta makers and makes all pasta in house.It‚Äôs good to point out, though, that the most popular machines are the most automated, not the hand-cranked metal rollers that many home cooks attach to their cooking islands. EmilioMiti‚Äôs bestseller is the Nina 250 from the Italian manufacturer Imperia & Monferrina, which can cost up to $5,000. It quickly transforms a ball of dough into pristine sheets that are 250mm (about 10 inches) wide. Other attachments cut the sheets into pappardelle or turn it into ready-to-slice ravioli, while an extruder makes spaghetti and other round, long shapes.Mitidieri points to pasta influencers on Instagram like Linda Miller Nicholson (@saltyseattle), a cookbook author who makes whimsical rainbow-hued creations with plant dyes, and Missy Robbins, chef of New York restaurant Lilia. When she shares photos of her mafaldine, long curly noodles with ruffled edges, or corzetti, flat, round pasta shapes stamped like coins, Mitidieri says chefs call him, saying, ‚ÄúWhatever machine Missy has, I want that.‚ÄùThe chefs‚Äô industriousness around all aspects of pasta creation make it difficult to keep up with the service calls. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going crazy. This one guy‚Äôs machine isn‚Äôt working because he‚Äôs milling his own grain. Pretty soon they‚Äôre going to pick up their own wheat from the ground!‚ÄùOn the other hand, there‚Äôs also a very practical reason behind the current frenzy for fresh pasta: It can be cooked to order in a couple of minutes, whereas dried pasta takes much longer. Many restaurants make fresh versions of Southern Italian pasta shapes that traditionally come in dried form, like spaghetti, so they don‚Äôt have to parcook it and ruin the texture.Overall, Mitidieri says, house-made pasta has a renaissance every decade for the same basic reason: It‚Äôs inexpensive to make, and everyone loves it.‚ÄúBesides a nice bowl of soup with ramen, what is the most soothing dish you can get? People think pasta,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn fact, I am having pasta at lunch.‚Äù"

It was going toward my face.""Kauffaman was running alone at Horsetooth Mountain Open Space near Fort Collins on Monday when he heard a noise and turned back. That's when the mountain lion attacked.

His face was visibly scratched and healing during Thursday's press briefing.The agency said the runner's movement apparently triggered the young lion's hunting instincts. The animal bit the man's face and wrist before he was able to break free and kill the lion.Kaufman told investigators he also choked the lion, and an examination of the animal confirmed that, said Rebecca Ferrell, a spokeswoman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife.The lion was less than a year old and tested negative for rabies.Ferrell said the runner did exactly what experts recommend in a rare encounter with a mountain lion ‚Äî fight back as hard as possible. They also advise trying to get back up on your feet if knocked over, look as big as possible and use anything handy as a weapon, such as a backpack or keys.Mountain lions rarely attack because they tend to avoid people. The animals have killed fewer than 20 people in North America in more than 100 years.In Colorado, where their population is strong, mountain lions have injured 16 people and killed three since 1990."

Now, I don‚Äôt have the time or patience to cook and peel a dozen tiny quail eggs, so in my version, I opt for quartering regular hard-boiled eggs.

Six years later, it‚Äôs fair to say she‚Äôs succeeded.Created and supported by some of the Bay Area‚Äôs top culinary talent ‚Äî Daniel Patterson, Craig Stoll and Bill Corbett serve as deans and the board of advisers includes Brandon Jew, Belinda Leong and Melissa Perello ‚Äî the San Francisco Culinary School has become a part of the city‚Äôs culinary scene.That‚Äôs no small feat when other more established Bay Area culinary schools, like San Francisco‚Äôs Le Cordon Bleu College (formerly known as California Culinary Academy) and the International Culinary Center in Campbell have closed their doors.Award-winning pastry chef Nicole Plue heads up the school‚Äôs pastry and baking arts program, which provides students with more than 700 hours of hands-on learning on how to make everything from intricate laminated pastries and cakes to homier creations like granola and these killer chocolate chip cookies.With the addition of rye flour and a splash of bourbon, along with a topping of vanilla bean-infused flaky sea salt, these beauties make for a fun twist on the standard Tollhouse affair.Feel free to make them year-round, but at this time of year, they‚Äôd be an excellent contribution to a holiday cookie exchange.

In a medium bowl, whisk all-purpose flour, rye flour, kosher salt and baking soda.In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar on medium speed, scraping down the sides as needed, until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add egg, vanilla and bourbon and beat until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and slowly add dry ingredients, mixing just to blend. Fold in chopped chocolate and remaining chocolate wafers.Size matters: There‚Äôs nothing wrong with using familiar chocolate chips, but incorporating both larger chocolate wafers and smaller processed bits into the dough helps the chocolate to suffuse the cookies more fully as they bake.Flour power: Rather than use only all-purpose flour, the addition of rye flour provides the cookies with a subtle, nutty flavor that plays nicely with the dark chocolate.Feeling salty: The importance of adding salt to sweets cannot be understated. As with savory dishes, salt gives desserts a flavor boost and helps make the other ingredients pop. In the case of these cookies, they get a double whammy from the kosher salt that‚Äôs mixed into the dough, along with the vanilla-infused flaky sea salt that‚Äôs sprinkled on top just before baking.Chill factor: Baking pros will tell you that chilling cookie dough for several hours and up to overnight helps enhance the flavor and create a chewier cookie. That said, don‚Äôt leave the dough in the fridge for more than 1 day, as the leavening agents will begin to degrade, which affects the rise and spread. The dough can also freeze for up to 2 months, but let it defrost before baking.Rotation station: Since ovens often have hot and cold spots, to promote even, golden brown baking, always rotate the baking sheets ‚Äî front to back and top to bottom ‚Äî halfway through.Portion dough into 16 balls (about ¬º cup each) and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill for at least 3 hours or up to 1 day.Position racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.Scrape vanilla seeds into a small bowl (save pods for another use) and mix in sea salt. Divide the balls of dough between two parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 3 inches apart. Let the balls temper for 10 to 15 minutes once removed from the refrigerator; this will help achieve crispy edges and soft middles. Then flatten each ball to about ¬æ-inch thick and sprinkle with the vanilla salt.Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, 14 to 18 minutes. Cookies will firm up as they cool, so it‚Äôs best to remove them from the oven when they still look a bit under-baked. Let cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely."
118.0,Food,"So far this winter, a farm in Placerville (El Dorado County) has found 1 pound of prized, elusive black truffles, leading to its first sale to a Northern California restaurant on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Around the same time, a 10-year-old Santa Rosa orchard also found its first truffle. Meanwhile, a nearby Santa Rosa orchard owned by Jackson Family Wines has unearthed an astonishing 25 pounds of truffles this season, some of which are being served in San Francisco restaurants like Saison, Birdsong and Che Fico.About a decade ago, California-grown black or P√©rigord truffles were at best a dream, and at worst a long shot. That‚Äôs when about a dozen farmers started planting orchards of hazelnut and oak trees, their roots inoculated with Tuber melanosporum spores. If the orchard was carefully tended, the first black truffles could form within five to eight years, though it would take a couple more years for an orchard to really bear fruit.It‚Äôs happening: For the first time, California has a truffle season, which goes from December into March, as growers are making serious progress toward creating a viable locally grown version of the European luxury ingredient.‚ÄúYou could almost smell the earth coming off them,‚Äù says Micah Malcolm of Taste Restaurant and Wine Bar in Plymouth (Amador County), who shaved farmer Staci O‚ÄôToole‚Äôs Placerville black truffles over mushroom ravioli for a $120 New Year‚Äôs Eve menu, and was willing to spend an extra $15 per ounce over the price of imported truffles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the earthy, sweet smell that is very captivating. Shaving it over something warm makes the oils break down. You could just smell it in the whole restaurant.‚ÄùAlthough there are other parts of the country where various types of truffles are grown, California is seen as being closest in climate to their native Southern Europe. But uncertainty remains. When a dog found the first truffle at the 10-year-old Santa Rosa orchard of Harshal Sanghavi and Matt Hicks in December, they immediately sent off the walnut-size tuber for DNA testing, which confirmed it was a Tuber melanosporum ‚Äî and not another random variety that sometimes crops up.‚ÄúIt was very exciting,‚Äù says Sanghavi, who has overseen years of intensive pruning, irrigation and re-inoculating of the trees at their orchard. ‚ÄúWe were looking for some kind of sign that we were doing the right thing.‚ÄùStaci O‚ÄôToole first visited the Placerville truffle orchard in 2016, when it was overgrown and neglected after being planted more than a decade before. She brought along her Lagotto Romagnolo, Mila, an Italian truffle-hunting breed with tightly curled mops of fur ‚Äî as cute as a Muppet and as serious as a foxhound.The pair were on-site for an hour when one of the property owners pointed over to Mila, who was digging a hole and then marking her find with a head shake, just as O‚ÄôToole had trained her. O‚ÄôToole remembers kneeling down and carefully moving back the dirt, then sticking her own nose in the ground.Mila had found their first Northern California truffle.‚ÄúI was so excited I started crying,‚Äù says O‚ÄôToole, who had been training Mila as a hobby. The 2016 find was so thrilling ‚Äî and prophetically, just 5 miles away from the first discovery of gold in California ‚Äî that O‚ÄôToole eventually convinced her husband to purchase the property as a truffle tourism project. She has spent the last few years rehabilitating the orchard on weekends, and they moved there permanently in December.Last week, culinary gardener Tucker Taylor brought one of the Jackson Family Wines truffles into the city to see if any of his chef contacts were interested in buying. Although truffles were first harvested at the winery two years ago, this is the first season they have extra to sell.Taylor, who made his name in the French Laundry garden and now runs the culinary gardens on Jackson Family Wines properties, says chefs find the aroma on par with black truffles imported from Europe: ‚ÄúThe chefs say the taste is between a summer truffle and a black P√©rigord,‚Äù he says, referring to the slightly less expensive and more chocolatey summer black truffle (Tuber aestivum). ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the type of soil.‚ÄùRather than the usual round nugget shape, one of the larger truffles was about 3 inches wide with multiple growths like camel humps. The aroma was of damp earth and funk but also Parmesan, dried tomato and pineapple. The lighter fruity and floral notes, which are more apparent in very fresh truffles, created an experience that you can imagine leads to impulsive real estate purchases.When Taylor brought truffles to Chris Bleidorn, chef at Birdsong, in the last week of December, Bleidorn told him he hadn‚Äôt planned to serve imported truffles at the restaurant. Having a local source changed that; Bleidorn used them in his New Year‚Äôs Eve menu and told Taylor he hopes to order more when the orchard‚Äôs production increases.Most diners will be struck by the immediate scent of a truffle shaved onto something warm; once cooled, say, on a slice of pizza, a sliver of truffle doesn‚Äôt hold much flavor.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre putting shavings on your dish that are just warmed and excited by some warm fat around it. So a lot of the experience is the aromatic part of eating,‚Äù says Ed Roehr, chef-owner of Magpie restaurant in Sacramento, who recently visited O‚ÄôToole‚Äôs orchard to watch Mila find a truffle. He describes the aroma as an oil-cured black olive moving toward dried cranberry, with a hint of earthiness.Even though Roehr considers Magpie an Italian restaurant of sorts, he doesn‚Äôt use imported truffles because he sticks to ingredients from the Central Valley and California. For that reason, he is excited about O‚ÄôToole‚Äôs endeavor.Fran Angerer of Alexander Valley Truffle Co. counts about 10 known truffle orchards in California that haven‚Äôt yet produced truffles, from San Luis Obispo to Willits (Mendocino County), including his own in Geyserville. He would love someone from UC Davis to take an interest and help California growers figure out the right growing methods.In the meantime, he says, he and several other local growers share tips.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been a very secretive business,‚Äù says Angerer, who has plans to plant another orchard in Healdsburg. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to open it up.‚ÄùNow that the Jackson Family Wines orchard is reaching maturity, the next step is to train the truffle dogs to not just find any truffle but to recognize when they are at the proper state of ripeness for digging up, says orchard manager Brian Malone.While her business is still at its beginnings, O‚ÄôToole envisions having a truffle tasting room and farm stays. She has embraced her truffle life, starting her day by walking her dogs through the orchard with her coffee, still in her pajamas.By the time she gets back, she says, ‚ÄúMy nose is as dirty as theirs because I‚Äôm sniffing around in the holes. My pajama pants are stained on the knees.‚ÄùBut with more truffles comes more responsibility, like a better infrastructure for selling them. ‚ÄúWhen you just get a few truffles each time you go hunting, it‚Äôs super easy to find a home for them,‚Äù Malone says. ‚ÄúWhen you start harvesting pounds at a time, you have to formulate a plan ahead of time.‚Äù"

Often dining alone, he frequented the kinds of places where menus are laminated, coffee is strong and locals order from memory ‚Äî notable departures from the upscale power restaurants favored by his predecessors.At Sam‚Äôs Diner, not far from City Hall on Market Street, Lee had his own table. It wasn‚Äôt actually something he asked for, owner Jeannie Kim said, but he came so often after taking office in 2011 that she felt she needed to make the visits more accommodating.So table number five at Sam‚Äôs Diner became Lee‚Äôs hangout, she said. He would sometimes host meetings there, ordering coffee and oatmeal. When he was alone and could relax, Kim said Lee would order his favorite dish: the Mahalo Loco Moco, which consists of a beef patty and two eggs over easy, layered on steamed rice and covered with brown gravy.‚ÄúHe was just here yesterday,‚Äù Kim said on Tuesday, her voice breaking as she spoke. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs gone. He meant so much to so many people.‚ÄùLee was also a regular at Rocco‚Äôs Cafe, located a few blocks away on Folsom Street. The 28-year-old Italian-American diner‚Äôs owner Don Dial shared similar tales, remembering how Lee would come in about every three weeks, sit near the window and stay for a good hour as he ate his usual order ‚Äî eggs over medium, crispy bacon and wheat toast.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really going to miss him,‚Äù said Dial.For many, Lee was a champion for small businesses and represented the way blue-collar San Franciscans dine. Instead of trendy destinations, he made appearances at places like Lam Hoa Thuan in the Sunset and took then-presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton to Red Blossom Tea Company in Chinatown.In 2012, Brenda Buenviaje of Brenda‚Äôs French Soul Food received a grant from the Mayor‚Äôs Office to upgrade the facade of her business. When the work was completed, Lee held a press conference at the restaurant to highlight the money being invested by the city to improve the Tenderloin neighborhood.‚ÄúAt the end of the press conference, they had him taking pictures with a bowl of shrimp and grits. He turned to me and asked if I could package it up so he could take it back to his office,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBeing around him was like being around family.‚ÄùIn a changing city, Lee played a key role in San Francisco‚Äôs legacy business registry. The city initiative, designed to preserve and celebrate businesses that have been open for at least 30 years and have contributed to their neighborhood‚Äôs history, came to fruition under his guidance and was approved by voters in November 2015.‚ÄúHe was just a down-to-earth guy. That‚Äôs main thing I‚Äôll always remember about him,‚Äù said Robert Aranda of Casa Sanchez, the local Mexican food company that dates back to 1923 and received legacy status in September. ‚ÄúHe was known for visiting small businesses and just asking people how he could help. I know we‚Äôve seen him multiple times.‚ÄùLee focused on neighborhoods, most notably Mid-Market. He wanted to revitalize the tumultuous corridor, at one point providing companies that moved into the neighborhood with temporary payroll tax exemptions. The tactic made him viewed as a tech ally, and helped spark a rush of restaurants to the area, to varying success.‚ÄúHe was always optimistic and hopeful. He wanted Mid-Market to have life, that meant so much to him,‚Äù Kim of Sam‚Äôs Diner said. ‚ÄúI know being that leadership it was a very lonely place, so he stressed a lot.

Though she‚Äôs quick to say she is grateful to a few supportive bosses and co-workers she‚Äôs had over the years, ‚Äúgetting looked over, not getting taken seriously enough‚Äù wore on her.To order: Farewell to Spring, Coastal Scrub (both $12)Where: Pearl 6101, 6101 California St., S.F. 415-592-9777 www.pearl6101.comWhen: 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday-Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday-Sunday (breakfast and lunch). 5 to 10 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday (dinner). Closed for dinner Monday.‚ÄúI‚Äôve left work crying so many times because I‚Äôve seen men get all the opportunities,‚Äù she says. The chance to be a partner at Pearl 6101 was too good to pass up, she says. ‚ÄúHaving a piece of this ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs small or big ‚Äî is symbolic. It makes me want to work even harder.‚ÄùEach department head ‚Äî bar manager, the two co-chefs, managers, pastry chef, cafe manager, wine director and beer manager ‚Äî owns a stake in the restaurant alongside founder Jack Murphy, who used a similar model to acquire Pizzetta 211 next door in 2008. There are no outside investors. And while hiring is equal opportunity, both Nazzal and chef-partners Mel Lopez and Joyce Conway see Pearl 6101 as a place where less-experienced women can get mentorship that‚Äôs not common elsewhere in the bar and restaurant worlds.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about encouraging confidence,‚Äù Conway says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre teaching technique so they can be strong women in this industry in the future, but also telling them that it‚Äôs OK that you‚Äôre still learning.‚ÄùNazzal says that just looking across to the kitchen can be a reminder of the support system they‚Äôve built here. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel isolated.

And I‚Äôm going to have to fight for sips. But I‚Äôm glad to be along for the ride.Nazzal has smartly edited the bar menu down to six cocktails (all $12) that taste at once both fresh and familiar. They‚Äôre mostly named for California native plants, and many feature spirits made at small distilleries.I can‚Äôt think of a more perfect appetite-whetter than her Farewell to Spring, which, like its namesake ruffled pink flower, is on the delicate end of the spectrum. Made with sparkling wine and lemon plus a Sicilian blood-orange amaro and a Pinot Gris-based aperitif from Oregon, it has a multilayered bright and bitter complexity that your standard Aperol spritz just doesn‚Äôt offer.Its citrusy sibling, the Coastal Scrub, is another easy favorite, offering even more exuberant citrus flavors. It‚Äôs spiced with a tincture made with cinnamon, anise, sage and mint that‚Äôs named for the ‚Äúgarbage tea‚Äù that Nazzal‚Äôs grandmother and aunts would make by steeping the dregs of all the spices in their cabinet. Mixed with gin, grapefruit liqueur and honey, the concoction is subtly tropical and fragrant, like grapefruit perfected.Nazzal is conscious of proof.  She tends to start her recipes with a lighter dose of whiskey or gin, then fill out a cocktail‚Äôs flavor with less-potent Sherries, vermouths and liqueurs.Thanks to her time at Anina and some travels through Spain, Nazzal has developed a gift for working with Sherry and creating drinks that illustrate the fortified wine‚Äôs wide spectrum of flavor, leaner than vermouth but offering a similar counterweight to stronger spirits.She likes to play with its acidity and nutty flavors, which vary depending on how and where the wine was made. High-quality cream Sherry adds chocolate and fig notes to a manhattan riff called the Copa de Oro. Meanwhile, Manzanilla Sherry contributes an oyster-shell mineral character to the Pearl Martini.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a neighborhood bar that‚Äôs basically two blocks from the bay,‚Äù Nazzal says. ‚ÄúThe fog is rolling in right there, so I wanted to have something salty and briny.‚Äù She uses a subtly aquatic Oakland Spirits gin that‚Äôs flavored with lemongrass and foraged nori, and adds a few dashes of California-made aquavit to accentuate the savory side of the drink.Back at the table, my friends swap dating stories and devour a plate of mussels escabeche ($12).

10.0,Biz+Tech,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 400 points Friday as renewed optimism over trade talks between the U.S. and China put investors in a buying mood.The rally marked a turnaround from a day earlier, when disappointing holiday sales data led to a modest sell-off. Friday's gains helped push the benchmark S&P 500 index to its third-consecutive weekly gain.Financial, health care, technology and industrial stocks accounted for much of the broad wave of buying. U.S. markets will be closed Monday in observance of Presidents Day.Two days of trade talks wrapped up Friday in Beijing. China's government said negotiators will meet in Washington next week for more negotiations aimed at ending the trade war between the world's largest economies.A March 2 deadline hangs over both sides, after which the U.S. is set to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods, escalating a trade dispute that has already raised costs for companies and consumers. President Donald Trump has said that there is a possibility he would extend that deadline if the two countries are close to a deal, however.Wall Street has been encouraged by the signals that Chinese and U.S. officials have sent in the latest round of trade talks that began Monday.That's given investors ""hopefulness and maybe optimism surrounding some sort of resolution between the U.S. and China,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. ""And maybe (both sides) keep talking and maybe delaying the implementation of the tariffs that are supposed to come into effect"" on March 2, Delwiche said, ""so, it's evidence of progress.""The S&P 500 index gained 29.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,775.60.

Major European indexes also finished higher, as did gold and crude oil prices.Markets moved higher for most of this week as investors grew more optimistic that the latest round of talks could move the U.S. and China closer to a resolution of their trade fight.On Friday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Chinese President Xi Jinping negotiators ""made headway"" in talks this week in Beijing.Economists said this week's two days of talks were too brief to resolve the sprawling dispute that extends to cyber-spying and China's trade surplus. They said Beijing is trying to persuade Trump enough progress is being made to postpone the penalties.The Trump administration raised tariffs in July over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. The White House imposed 25 percent penalties on $50 billion of goods from China and 10 percent on $200 billion of other products. China retaliated by raising duties on American soybeans and other imports and ordering its companies to find other suppliers.While the trade conflict remains a focus of the market, a resolution may not be enough to ease a growing sense among investors that the global economy is slowing, setting the stage for weaker corporate earnings growth this year, Delwiche said.""I'm not one to think that getting this trade deal done is going to all of a sudden clear up a bunch of uncertainty around the economy, particularly the global economy,"" he said. ""We need to see some evidence that the global economy is stabilizing. That's really where you're getting the downward pressure on earnings expectations.""So far, S&P 500 companies have reported 13.1 percent earnings growth for the October-December quarter, better than the 12.1 percent gain projected by analysts.

Its forecast for the year topped Wall Street's forecasts.Nvidia has been hurt by a plunge in demand from the cryptocurrency sector and lower video game console sales.Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo gained 2.9 percent despite reporting relatively soft fourth-quarter results. Much like rival Coca-Cola on Thursday, the company gave investors a weak forecast for the year as it faces a stronger dollar. Unlike its rival, PepsiCo announced $8 billion in stock buy backs and a round of cost cuts.Agricultural equipment maker Deere slid 2.1 percent after warning that farmers are buying less new equipment because of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The company gave investors a mixed fourth-quarter report, with profit falling short and revenue beating forecasts.Newell Brands plunged 20.9 percent. The loss of retailer Toys R US hurt the company's core sales. Newell makes a range of baby products that were carried by the now defunct Babies R US.Mattel tumbled 18.3 percent after the toy maker issued a weaker-than-expected 2019 revenue outlook.

Strauss‚Äô descendants, members of the Haas family, own at least 60 percent of the company.The filing stated that a portion of the proceeds could go to ‚Äúacquisitions or other strategic investments,‚Äù but the company said it currently did not have such plans.Following the announcement, other publicly traded retailers ‚Äî including American Eagle, Urban Outfitters and San Francisco‚Äôs Gap Inc. ‚Äî saw their stock prices drop.‚ÄúUsually news like this would bring the industry up,‚Äù said Kris Dunning, retail analyst at Moss Adams, an investment research firm.While he thought other factors were at play in the movement, he said ‚Äúa private company and market leader like Levi‚Äôs going public and taking advantage of the market could make investors relocate some of their investment.‚ÄùThe denim market has made somewhat of a comeback after staving off pressures from athleisure companies like Lululemon that dug into its market share, Bloomberg‚Äôs Grazutis said.‚ÄúSome of that has to do with fashion trends and the move by denim companies to make jeans from stretchy material,‚Äù he said.Levi‚Äôs said its top five markets include the United States, France, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Revenue in these five regions increased from $3 billion in 2015 to $3.5 billion in 2018.Levi‚Äôs reported 2018 revenue of $5.58 billion, up 9 percent compared to 2017, and net income of $283 million, up 17 percent over the same time period. It also reduced its debt by $400 million to $1.15 billion in 2018 over a five-year period.It sells its apparel through its own name-branded stores, chain retailers, department stores and online sites.

The production hub was open along the waterfront for less than a year before moving to 671 Fourth St., roughly a mile away.Chris Jordan, Tartine‚Äôs chief operating officer, said the Fourth Street space, which is in the same industrial area as Temescal Brewing‚Äôs new production facility, is ‚Äúa more ideal fit for our roasting growth in Northern California.‚Äù It remains a commercial roaster that‚Äôs not open to the public.After national developer CIM Group purchased the Jack London Square property in 2016 as part of a $131 million deal, Coffee Manufactory was billed as an anchor tenant, one that would help attract other restaurant and retail businesses. At the time, Tartine said it planned to make the space its headquarters for the coffee operation and open a retail business. The retail spot never happened.A CIM representative declined to comment on Tartine‚Äôs exit, citing a policy against speaking publicly about tenant agreements. CIM also would not confirm what business might be taking over Tartine‚Äôs former space.While Tartine‚Äôs exit may have come as a surprise, other restaurant tenants have found Jack London Square a better fit.Sustainable meat specialist Belcampo, Burmese restaurant Grocery Cafe, Thai restaurant Farmhouse Kitchen and Reem Assil‚Äôs Dyafa remain notable draws.So are Brooklyn West and Irish bar Sl√°inte, both of which opened in 2017, as well as Plank, the spacious restaurant, bowling alley and beer garden that took over the former Barnes & Noble space in 2014.The neighborhood is also being mentioned as part of the Oakland Athletics‚Äô proposed stadium plans at Howard Terminal. The ambitious project includes the construction of a gondola that would travel near the Marriott City Center at Washington and 10th streets, as well as Water and Washington streets near Jack London Square.The Bay Area Council Economic Institute released a study last month saying the gondola would bring an additional 50,000 visitors to Oakland and would generate around $403 million in sales, some of it from increased Jack London Square tourism.The latest project to come to life at Jack London Square might be one of its most popular ‚Äî Ayesha Curry‚Äôs Homemade, a temporary retail store selling her home goods.

32.0,US & World,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) ‚Äî Nearly half of Tennessee students enrolled in higher education during the 2016-2017 school year needed some sort of remedial classes during their first year of college, according to new state data.The Tennessee Higher Education Commission released the numbers this week which have since sparked shock and dismay from lawmakers who have taken pride in touting the state's gains in education over the past few years.According to the report, 46 percent of higher education enrollees needed math remediation while 30 percent of enrollees needed reading remediation during that first year of college. Students need to take remedial classes if they score 18 or below on an ACT subtest.Sen. Jon Lundberg, a Republican from Bristol who asked the commission for the data, described the numbers as a rude wakeup call.""People are going to take different impressions of this and go, well, this is the fault of so-and-so. It's not,"" Lundberg said. ""The success of our students is everyone's best interest.""In 2016, Tennessee restructured how remedial courses at Tennessee community colleges and universities operated by allowing freshman students deemed unprepared for college-level work to take for-credit courses while enrolling in learning support classes. The new system replaced earlier rules that required underprepared students to pass a remedial course before taking college-level courses.The change was hailed as a much-needed solution after seeing many college students were stalling in remedial courses and not earning the college credits needed to graduate. And while remediation numbers did decline in the following years, the commission's data revealed there's still much more work to do in order to ensure students are prepared to succeed in college.""I think in every presentation that I have personally done in the past couple of years, I've talked about and said I'm so proud of Tennessee. We're the fastest growing state when it comes to K-12 education and we all pat ourselves on the back. It's been great. But it's difficult to put that into context,"" Lundberg said.The commission's data shows wide variances on both a school district and county level.For example, every student that went on to college in 2016-2017 from three Shelby County high schools needed math remediation. Those same schools had similarly high numbers for students needing reading remediation. However, overall, 58 percent of Shelby County students that went onto college needed math remediation and 40 percent needed reading remediation.""Unfortunately, I have to point out that all three of these are in my home county of Shelby. And I just point that out ... to remind the members that we do really need some help in Shelby County. We have some major challenges to overcome and we need to address that this year,"" said Sen. Brian Kelsey, a Republican from Collierville.In Davidson County ‚Äî home of Nashville's schools ‚Äî more than 62 percent of students that went into the state's college system in that same year needed math remediation and 47 percent needed reading remediation.The data only showed students who went on to college and not those who presumably also scored low on the ACT and did not go on to college. This means the overall college-ready rates are likely even more stark, said Emily House, the chief policy and strategy officer for the commission.Despite the bleak numbers, Mike Krause, executive director of the higher education commission, says Tennessee's recent success of improving its K-12 education and getting more kids to college over the years are a reason to remain hopeful."

Whipped cream
Whipped cream1 cup very cold heavy whipping cream¬º teaspoon Tahitian vanilla extract1 tablespoon powdered sugar, plus more to garnishFor the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch cake pan and dust very lightly with flour or line with parchment paper. (If you plan to turn the cake out of the pan before cutting, also line it with parchment paper, which helps the cake release more easily.)Spice up your life: For maximum flavor, the cake boasts a double-punch of ginger with fresh and powdered. Cinnamon, cloves and white pepper round out the mixture for a complex, spice-rich cake that‚Äôs perfect for the holiday season.Sticky situation: Dark molasses (also labeled ‚Äúfull‚Äù) is more intensely flavored and less sweet than light or mild molasses. Avoid using blackstrap, which is less sweet and has a stronger flavor than dark molasses.Cara-mellow out: Caramel can be a fickle beast, so make sure you have all your ingredients and tools measured out and in order before you start cooking. The addition of both corn syrup and cream of tartar will help keep the sauce smooth and prevent sugar crystals from forming.Whip it good: Along with making sure your cream is nice and cold, popping your mixing bowl and whisk into the freezer to chill for about 15 minutes prior to whisking will help the cream to fluff up faster and with more volume. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt overwhip your cream or else you‚Äôll end up with butter.Do-aheads: If serving a large group dinner or potluck, you can pre-cut the cake into 2-inch squares in advance and reheat for 2¬Ω minutes in a 350 degree oven. The caramel sauce can also be made ahead and refrigerated. Carefully reheat in a water bath or in a microwave before using.Combine ginger with ¬Ω tablespoon water in a mixing bowl; add sugar, oil and molasses. Mix on low speed. Add eggs; continue mixing at low speed until fully incorporated.Combine flour, cinnamon, cloves, white pepper, ground ginger and baking soda in another mixing bowl. Add dry ingredients slowly to the egg mixture, continuing to beat slowly, scraping mixing bowl occasionally. Increase speed to medium for 2 minutes. Scrape; decrease speed to low and slowly add ¬æ cup hot tap water. Mix until just combined, occasionally scraping. (The batter will be slightly thin.)Pour into prepared cake pan and bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes.For the caramel sauce: In a medium-size stainless steel pot, combine sugar and 1¬æ cups hot water, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add corn syrup and cream of tartar; mix. Wipe down the inside top of the pot with a wet towel to remove any sugar crystals. If needed, also brush inside of pot just once with a wet pastry brush. Bring to a boil over high heat without stirring, until mixture becomes a deep caramel color or a candy thermometer reaches 335 degrees.Remove pot from heat and immediately add cream in a slow stream while stirring (be careful ‚Äî it will pop and sputter). Whisk in salt and the butter, a little at a time. Makes approximately 2 cups.For the whipped cream: Vigorously whisk cream, vanilla extract and powdered sugar in a cold bowl until the cream reaches soft peaks. You want the cream to be relatively soft so it can slowly run over the sides of the cake. Makes about 2 cups."

82.0,Other,"In theory, the Brew Coop could be a beer fan‚Äôs dream situation.The bar, or ‚Äúself-pour taproom,‚Äù as owner Gore Song describes it, lets you fill your own glass from any of 21 different beer taps ‚Äî or a few more offering cider, kombucha, sake and wine. You can try an inch or a pint, watch whatever game is on, then try another.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more of a tasting experience,‚Äù Song explained to a group of hesitant newcomers who arrived shortly after I did one evening. Song, who opened the Valencia Street spot this month, says he was inspired by a self-pour bar in Prague that he visited six years ago, but the model seems custom-fit for San Francisco‚Äôs tight labor market today.Here‚Äôs how it works: When you enter the Brew Coop, you start a tab by exchanging cash or a credit card for a plastic payment card, then proceed to the neon lights reading BEER YOURSELF. You‚Äôre the bartender. Activate the tap by sliding your payment card into a slot above your chosen brew, then pour as much as you‚Äôd like. (Prices appear when you insert the card, before you start pouring.) The card tracks every ounce you pour, spitting out a long receipt at the register before you leave.The setup feels unfamiliar. At most bars, you know what to do: Pull up a seat, exchange pleasantries with the barkeep, and choose a drink. If it‚Äôs not too crowded, you might linger over your pint and talk about your neighborhood, what‚Äôs on TV, what you do for a living. There‚Äôs often music, a feeling of being somewhere cooler than your kitchen table. You might be rooting for the same team as everyone in the room, or you might give your barstool neighbor a hard time about their starting lineup.That human exchange matters. We can drink at home, but bars invite us to be together, to drink well with others.If we‚Äôre just here for the beer, then the beer better be damn good. And that‚Äôs where Brew Coop doesn‚Äôt live up to its promise as an innovative ‚Äútasting experience.‚ÄùAbout half of the list comes from local breweries, including HenHouse‚Äôs Stoked on Mosaic Pale Ale, Standard Deviant‚Äôs hefeweizen, Social Kitchen‚Äôs pilsner, and Seven Stills‚Äô hazy IPA, with the rest filled in with familiar choices like Allagash White and Ballast Point‚Äôs Grapefruit Sculpin. The taps are arranged by general style ‚Äî hoppy, lighter, malty, tart.On my first visit, I spent $1.05 on 1.981 ounces of Johnny Utah Pale Ale from Seattle‚Äôs Georgetown Brewing Co., and $4.66 on 7.767 ounces of a hazy IPA from Black Hammer Brewing in San Francisco. The self-serve process draws your attention to the cost of every sip, but the prices aren‚Äôt really egregious for today‚Äôs Valencia Street: That IPA, at 60 cents an ounce, comes out to $7.20 for a 12-ounce pour.Song, who most recently worked as the manager and beer buyer at Soda Popinski‚Äôs, will offer beer recommendations if you ask, but in general, customers take the reins here, learning what they like by tasting, not talking. You‚Äôre unlikely to stand around near the wall having a long conversation about dry hopping. Song hopes the setup will feel accessible to intimidated beginners who might not have tasted the products of many different breweries before.But more than any other bar I‚Äôve been to in recent years, I‚Äôve found that people need a simile to wrap their heads around the Brew Coop.One friend tried to follow the operating instructions, then exclaimed: ‚ÄúOh! It‚Äôs like a gas station, but with beer!‚Äù She sprang to the taps, her eyes widening as the ounces ‚Äî and dollars ‚Äî rolled up.When I proposed this review, my editor asked if the system was something like the soda station at a McDonald‚Äôs. On one hand, the Brew Coop seems to inspire a similar glee. The bar‚Äôs fans on Yelp crow about their ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù concoctions ‚Äî mixes of every beer on the back wall in one (full) glass. I‚Äôm not sure I have the patience to insert the payment card into the slot above each collection of taps more than 10 times in a row, so I haven‚Äôt tried it. Also: gross.Rest assured, the tap area is significantly less sticky than your standard soda machine, though some achievement-oriented patrons do run up their tabs tasting their way through, leaving a pool of discarded beer in the drain that spans the spouts.Brew Coop feels less like a taproom than like the basement rec room ‚Äî or converted cafeteria ‚Äî in a college dorm, the cement floors crammed with unadorned tables and benches. It‚Äôs not a very comfortable place to watch a game, though Song installed so many flat screens that there‚Äôs barely more than a foot between them. (‚ÄúMan, you guys need more TVs,‚Äù snarked a customer who arrived shortly after I did.)My fellow professional barfly Camper English of the Alcademics blog summed up the experience in a tweet as being akin to ‚Äúdrinking beer in the TV department of Best Buy.‚Äù They‚Äôve adjusted the lighting in recent weeks, which helps, but he has a point.On a recent Monday, there wasn‚Äôt a game on the docket, but several tables of drinkers were raptly following the closed captions as former linebacker Colton Underwood practiced his tongue kiss on ‚ÄúThe Bachelor.‚Äù Some watchers drank the white wine, a generic California Chardonnay; others liked Holy Craft Brewing Co.‚Äôs slightly tart yuzu-tinged Japanese rice lager.My tablemates had given up on trying different options, though, finding that they‚Äôd already sampled many of the beers on tap elsewhere.Most drinkers these days ‚Äî even those who consider themselves beginners ‚Äî don‚Äôt need to sample an ounce of Lagunitas IPA or Firestone‚Äôs 805 Blonde. Most people who have been to a bar in San Francisco have already tried Speakeasy‚Äôs Baby Daddy at least once. If Song would diversify, focusing more of the list on rare options and new releases not often poured elsewhere, the Brew Coop could be a destination for beer lovers ‚Äî or a spot that could encourage newbies to care about beer.Otherwise, I‚Äôd just as soon fill ‚Äôer up somewhere else.To order: Founders Porter; Far West Cider‚Äôs You‚Äôve Guava Be Kidding Me.

55.0,Food,"Greeting visitors to the Budweiser brewery and tasting room in Fairfield as they stagger from their cars in the searing heat of a Solano County summer is a hulking statue of a draft horse. Neither horses nor statues can talk, but if this one could, it would have tales to tell. Unsubtly mounted near the creature‚Äôs hooves is a plaque ‚Äî not a sign, a plaque ‚Äî stating ‚ÄúPLEASE DO NOT GET ON THE CLYDESDALE.‚ÄùBudweiser, now the flagship label of multinational conglomerate AB-InBev, hasn‚Äôt relied upon a Clydesdale-centered distribution system for quite some time. The Fairfield brewery, one of 12 Budweiser plants nationwide, was erected in 1976. Big rigs and train cars on a spur line that rumbles right through the brewery depart at all hours. If you‚Äôre cracking a Bud or Bud Light in Northern California, northern Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Alaska or Hawaii, it all but certainly came from here. So, it‚Äôs clear the Budweiser people long ago devised how to bring products from the brewery to the masses. But, as the put-upon Clydesdale indicates, bringing the masses to the brewery comes with different challenges.Yes, the notion of traveling to experience Budweiser et al. in a tasting-room environment comes off as absurd ‚Äî one could argue that all of America has become a de facto AB-InBev tasting room. Perhaps the only place you can‚Äôt drink AB-InBev products, however, is on the Highway Transportation System. Accordingly, your humble narrator was thrilled to take Exit 56 and trade Interstate 80 traffic for the tasting room on Busch Drive.Ads on display here, tracing back to 1913 ‚Äî the year Adolphus Busch lifted his last pint ‚Äî boast the ‚Äúever-increasing demand for Budweiser‚Äù is largely thanks to its ‚Äúuniform‚Äù flavor. The company has long been famed for its punctiliousness; through fanatical devotion to consistency, the Budweiser you drink in San Francisco will taste nearly identical to the Budweiser you drink in Homer, Alaska, or Bangor, Maine.‚ÄúAnheuser-Busch‚Äôs quality ‚Äî if quality is consistency ‚Äî is second to none,‚Äù Dogfish Head founder Sam Calagione told the New Yorker in 2008. But, he continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm frustrated that one beer has been hammered down people‚Äôs throats.‚Äù In the years since then, the world‚Äôs major brewers have grown ever more massive via consolidation while also engaging in an arms race of craft brewery acquisitions. Beers from Elysian, 10 Barrel, Golden Road and Four Peaks now slosh about in the dirigible-size tanks of the Fairfield brewery.The marriage between craft beers and AB-InBev has been a delicate, often tumultuous one, and that‚Äôs reflected in the Fairfield tasting room, which was in 2014 treated to a massive renovation. The resultant 6,000-square-foot space gamely attempts to balance disparate tastes: The wall-size televisions show NASCAR, but the sound system plays light rock. The decor would seem apropos in a bar, but the space is relaxed and well-lit and airy, and the tables are so fastidiously clean you could eat off of them. It almost feels as if the designers were handed photos of the dingy Paddy‚Äôs Pub from ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia‚Äù and told to make it the exact opposite.It‚Äôs no secret that the Millennial generation has not cottoned to the King of Beers with the alacrity its parents did. This, in part, explains the binge of craft brew acquisitions. That may be a winning business strategy, but it has led to odd situations within the Budweiser tasting room.As such: You can, for $10, buy flights of beers and receive tutorials from a ‚Äúflight instructor.‚Äù Selections include Fields and Orchards (Bud Light Lime, Stella Cidre, Cherry-Ahh-Rita and Wild Blue, a syrupy blueberry lager packing an 8 percent alcohol-by-volume kick); Around the World (Budweiser, Stella Artois, Leffe and Bass); and Fairfield Brewed (Bud Light, Budweiser, Rolling Rock and Shock Top Belgian White).Yes, food pairings are involved: The suggested meal to accompany Goose Island Pilsner is tri-tip; Rolling Rock complements citrus-grilled chicken or smoked salmon; and Budweiser goes with ‚Äúany burger‚Äù or ‚Äî why not? ‚Äî filet mignon. Most jarringly, the suggestions for Bud Light were ‚Äúlight pastas or a triple-creme brie.‚Äù On cue, at the moment that advice was proffered, a pair of stock cars on the TV over the flight instructor‚Äôs shoulder careened into a wall. It was all too neat a metaphorical collision.It is unclear whether anybody has ever deeply pondered what to pair with Bud Light, which has traditionally been paired with more Bud Light (and then wearing the 12-pack box like a hat, and then getting on the Clydesdale).But Jennivive Soriano, the tasting-room supervisor and a 20-year tour guide at the brewery, says the idea is to emphasize that the products crafted here in Fairfield ‚Äúare not just party beers.‚Äù Now, for $30, you can take a Beermaster Tour and sip Budweiser directly from the finishing tank while standing in a vast room chilled to 36 degrees.Or, for a fraction of that money, you could buy a pail of Bud at the tasting room. That‚Äôs the route Jimmy Antuna went. By July, he‚Äôd driven up here from Orange County four times; he‚Äôll visit the nearby Jelly Belly factory, fill a gallon-size growler at the brewery and then hit Six Flags in Vallejo. ‚ÄúThis is a conversation starter,‚Äù said the 25-year-old hospital worker. ‚ÄúI tell people this is beer fresh from the Budweiser brewery.‚ÄùIt did not elude Antuna or any of the room‚Äôs patrons that they had traveled, in some cases many miles, to taste a beer painstakingly crafted to taste the same when it traveled many miles to them. But nobody seemed disappointed. Several tables over, Lori Lowell of Woodside claimed her favorite, Bud Light, tastes better when you know how it‚Äôs made. Her companion, Jesie Flores, began to protest that he‚Äôs a ‚ÄúCoors guy.‚Äù He touted its Rocky Mountain water, but she cut him off. ‚ÄúThat water,‚Äù she assured, ‚Äúis in his brain. This tastes much better.‚ÄùSoriano hopes, in the near future, to hold food-and-beer pairing banquets here, and have meals available on-site. In the meantime, the brewery is amenable to patrons packing in their own lunch. When asked what would pair well with a pastrami sandwich and pretzels, the bartender paused. But only for a nanosecond; through the window behind her, the name of the world‚Äôs most ubiquitous beer is spelled out in building-size red letters on the side of the brewery. ‚ÄúI think,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou should get a Budweiser.‚Äù Joe Eskenazi was born in San Francisco and has covered it journalistically since circa 2000.

24.0,Other,"WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Let the lawsuits begin.President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border and predicted his administration would end up defending it all the way to the Supreme Court.That might have been the only thing Trump said Friday that produced near-universal agreement.The American Civil Liberties Union announced its intention to sue less than an hour after the White House released the text of Trump's declaration that the ""current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.""Nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen filed suit later, urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to ""bar Trump and the U.S. Department of Defense from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several Democratic state attorneys general already have said they might go to court.The coming legal fight seems likely to hinge on two main issues: Can the president declare a national emergency to build a border wall in the face of Congress' refusal to give him all the money he wanted and, under the federal law Trump invoked in his declaration, can the Defense Department take money from some congressionally approved military construction projects to pay for wall construction?The Pentagon has so far not said which projects might be affected.But after weeks of publicly ruminating whether to act, Trump's signature on the declaration set in motion a quick march to the courthouse.Trump relied on the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which Congress adopted as a way to put some limits on presidential use of national emergencies. The act requires a president to notify Congress publicly of the national emergency and to report every six months. The law also says the president must renew the emergency every year, simply by notifying Congress. The House and Senate also can revoke a declaration by majority vote, though it would take a two-thirds vote by each house to override an expected presidential veto.Beyond that, though, the law doesn't say what constitutes a national emergency or impose any other limits on the president.The broad grant of discretion to the president could make it hard to persuade courts to rule that Trump exceeded his authority in declaring a border emergency. ""He's the one who gets to make the call. We can't second-guess it,"" said John Eastman, a professor of constitutional law at the Chapman University School of Law.Courts often are reluctant to look beyond the justifications the president included in his proclamation, Ohio State University law professor Peter Shane said on a call organized by the liberal American Constitution Society.But other legal experts said the facts are powerfully arrayed against the president. They include government statistics showing a decades-long decline in illegal border crossings as well as Trump's rejection of a deal last year that would have provided more than the nearly $1.4 billion he got for border security in the budget agreement he signed Thursday. Opponents of the declaration also are certain to use Trump's own words at his Rose Garden news conference Friday to argue that there is no emergency on the border.""I could do the wall over a longer period of time,"" Trump said. ""I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.""Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said Congress made a conscious choice not to give Trump what he wanted. ""A prerequisite for declaring an emergency is that the situation requires immediate action and Congress does not have an opportunity to act,"" Amash said on Twitter.ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said Trump's remarks are an admission that there is no national emergency. ""He just grew impatient and frustrated with Congress,"" Romero said in a statement that also said the rights group would file a lawsuit next week.Trying to turn the president's words against him failed in the challenge to Trump's ban on travel to the United States by citizens of several mostly Muslim countries. The ban's opponents argued that Trump's comments as a candidate and as president showed the ban was motivated by anti-Muslim bias, not concern about national security. Lower courts struck down the ban, but the Supreme Court upheld it in a 5-4 vote last year.Trump said he expected to lose in lower courts that he claims have been unfair to him, particularly if lawsuits are filed in California. ""Hopefully, we'll get a fair shake and we'll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban,"" he said.Beyond the challenge to Trump's authority to declare an emergency, lawsuits also are expected to focus on the military construction project law that allows the re-allocation of money in a national emergency.Eastman said he doubts that the Supreme Court would try to interfere with Trump's decision to send the military to the border and then authorize the use of money from other Defense Department construction projects to build miles of a border wall. ""The president is authorized to make those judgments, not some judge in San Francisco,"" Eastman said.But the ACLU's suit will argue that Congress allowed for flexibility in using money it appropriated for projects needed to support the emergency use of the military forces, like overseas military airfields in wartime.Several legal experts said claims that the building of the wall is not the kind of project contemplated in the military construction law could be more difficult to rebut because border security is more like a law enforcement issue than a military emergency."
135.0,Food,"Mikey Yoon has a thing for American cheese.It‚Äôs not just that the melted texture makes for the perfect gooey complement to the squishy, ultra-comforting burgers (although it does) that Yoon, 37, serves out of the postage-size kitchen inside the Lodge bar on Piedmont Avenue. His connection to this processed, by-the-slice product runs much deeper, back to his upbringing in the capital beltway of Maryland and to his first-generation Korean American parents.‚ÄúAmerican cheese is so integrated in Korean cuisine,‚Äù Yoon says. ‚ÄúGrowing up, I‚Äôd put American cheese on everything: on sandwiches, on ramen, kimchi, corn, things like that. It was awesome.‚ÄùIt was also the cheese of choice at his parents‚Äô serve-everything American deli, where Yoon cut his culinary teeth cranking out sandwiches, burgers, wingboxes (fried chicken wings served atop fries) with mumbo sauce, cheesesteaks, and the occasional Salisbury steak special to a primarily African American clientele in Prince George‚Äôs County just outside of Washington, D.C..So it was the obvious cheesy kicker to the signature item at Lovely‚Äôs, a months-old diner-inspired pop-up where Yoon obsessively re-creates the kind of accessible grub that he grew up eating. The streamlined menu offers what sounds like basic fare: cheeseburgers, chili cheeseburgers, a fried chicken sandwich and a veggie burger with sides like fries, hush puppies and fried mushrooms. The food‚Äôs familiarity and affordability ‚Äî a single cheeseburger rings in at $6 ‚Äî belies the work that goes into it.Yoon logs 60- to 70-hour weeks at the Lodge. Through a narrow ordering window located just below a stuffed goat head (befitting the venue‚Äôs cabin motif), bar patrons can see him in the cramped kitchen, hemmed in by towering cases of beer and to-go boxes, with his signature double braids draped down the front of his shirt.For the burgers, he hand-grinds Angus beef daily, makes his own mayo for the burger sauce and shops farmers‚Äô markets for the tomatoes, chopped lettuce and onions to be stewed in schmaltz. The dry brine for the chicken, which he serves with a Southern-style ‚Äúcomeback sauce‚Äù remoulade, takes a day and a half. He slices the potatoes for the fries to order with a hand press and makes his chili from scratch using techniques he learned living in Kansas City, where in his spare time he entered ‚Äî and won ‚Äî a Midwest-style chili cook-off. (By the way, the chili secret, he says, is to layer in different seasonings at different times during the cooking process.)‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs just me in there every day, there‚Äôs constantly something I can improve on,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere are all these little, small, minute details that can make a dish better and it‚Äôs no different with a burger. Even the french fries: I know it‚Äôs such a simple thing ‚Äî it‚Äôs a french fry ‚Äî but why not try to make the best damn fry, you know what I mean?‚ÄùThe result is a kind of idealized version of the comfort fare of Yoon‚Äôs youth.‚ÄúI think the idea came to me when I was in Missouri and it really dawned on me that the classic drive-through version, like from McDonald‚Äôs or Burger King, is most people‚Äôs first experience when they eat a burger,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI grew up eating my mom‚Äôs Korean food at home, but I also ate those kinds of burgers and at my parents‚Äô deli all the time. To be honest, food-wise I‚Äôm as much American as I am Asian.‚ÄúIt brings up strong emotions when I eat that kind of sloppy cheeseburger, so nostalgia-wise I knew I wanted to do a diner concept. And I didn‚Äôt want to do a huge burger with blue cheese and all this other stuff. I wanted something super simple off the griddle like my mama did.‚ÄùHis mother has come around to the idea of Yoon following in her footsteps in the kitchen, but that wasn‚Äôt always the case. His folks weren‚Äôt at all keen on him getting into the food business. Instead they encouraged him to become a doctor. In fact, Yoon was accepted into a nursing program in the Bay Area ‚Äî he earned his prerequisites from City College of San Francisco while working at Greg Dunmore‚Äôs izakaya, Nojo. He later moved to Savannah, Ga., where he was accepted into a cheaper program.He never actually enrolled at either.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what it was, to be honest; something just kept me from going,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, I kept cooking the whole time. Then this opportunity came up and I decided to give it one last shot.‚ÄùDespite the long hours, Yoon has been enjoying the ride, taking pride at people steadily discovering Lovely‚Äôs, which he launched with a deliberately low profile to give him time to ramp up operations.‚ÄúI live here, man, but I‚Äôm really happy visualizing what the next step is,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to push, that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs different when you‚Äôre running your own thing. My body is certainly tired, but mentally I‚Äôm a very happy person.‚ÄùHe‚Äôs launching a new pop-up on Mondays at Oakland's Starline Social Club starting December 10, and says that he‚Äôd eventually love to have his own brick-and-mortar diner ‚Äî a place that serves good basic food like burgers, sandwiches, milkshakes and pies. Maybe that means a welcoming environment similar to Japanese fried chicken specialist Aburaya in Oakland, where Yoon worked and which was a big influence on him.Or his parents‚Äô delis.‚ÄúOne thing that really rang true to me growing up was my parents always owned these small businesses that brought the community in,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúI would see the same people again and again ‚Äî there was a lot of bartering going on, a lot of just community talk. I think that‚Äôs been lost throughout the years. I have a really soft spot for these small mom-and-pop places, regardless if the food isn‚Äôt fine dining.‚ÄùFor the short-term, Yoon has more modest goals. He‚Äôd like to get to the point where he can hire help to allow him to expand his menu. He‚Äôs already working on new items, like a Korean fried chicken sandwich and yet another staple from his youth.‚ÄúI‚Äôve been testing a filet of fish sandwich,‚Äù Yoon says excitedly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting there and it‚Äôs so good. I have a really good connect with a fisherman in Half Moon Bay, and when you get fish that fresh you don‚Äôt want to do too much too it. But I have to keep the American cheese.‚ÄùLovely‚Äôs inside the Lodge: 3758 Piedmont Ave., Oakland. Open Wednesday-Thursday, 4-10 p. m. and Friday until 11 p.m."
64.0,Food,"Since I usually drink ice-loaded glasses of sweet lemonade on hot summer days, sometimes I find it hard to reconcile that lemons and most of their citrus siblings are winter fruit.Like apples, lemons taste their best when harvested in the cooler months of the year because the lower temperatures signal the fruit‚Äôs inner cells to activate enzymes that help the fruit achieve its maximum flavor potential in taste, aroma and texture. But heat can also play a marvelous role in their transformation. Sear a lemon on the hot grates of a grill and you‚Äôll immediately notice how much more fragrant it is. The same goes for including lemons and apples with a roast chicken.When I roast meats in my oven, I usually prefer to ‚Äúwet roast‚Äù them, because I find that it is a forgiving method that produces great results. Simply put, ‚Äúwet‚Äù refers to the addition of liquid ‚Äî such as water, broth or wine ‚Äî in a pan over which the meat cooks. When the liquid transforms into steam, it creates humidity in the enclosed oven space, preventing the meat from drying out as it cooks. The liquid also starts to enrich in flavor as it collects the drippings from the meat. In turn, this mixture should be used to baste the meat, creating a much more flavorful roast.Nik Sharma‚Äôs first solo cookbook is ‚ÄúSeason‚Äù (Chronicle Books). Email: food@sfchronicle.comRecipe: Roasted Chicken With Apples and MintHere‚Äôs a tip to core an apple for this recipe: use a spoon.

Set aside.Place the apples, onion, lemons and ginger in a large roasting pan or baking dish and toss with remaining salt. Set aside.Dab the chicken pieces dry with a clean paper towel. Using your hands, gently ease the skin to create a loose space between the chicken‚Äôs flesh and the skin. Apply the walnut seasoning in the space between the skin and the chicken flesh in as many places as possible, as well as on top of the skin.

69.0,Food,"It would be tempting to call Verjus, the concept from Michael and Lindsay Tusk of Quince and Cotogna that opens Thursday, a natural wine bar. But unfortunately defining a natural wine bar these days is as thorny as defining natural wine itself.Of the 400-odd wines offered at Verjus (550 Washington St., S.F.), all are fermented with indigenous yeast, picked by hand rather than by machine and ‚Äúnot in any way what you‚Äôd call industrial,‚Äù says beverage director Matt Cirne. Is that enough? Not for some natural wine diehards, for whom certain processes like sulfur additions are a line in the sand. When it comes to that ‚Äî in fact, when it comes to whether a wine producer would define himself or herself as natural ‚Äî well, Cirne isn‚Äôt going there.Either way, Verjus is certainly operating ‚Äúin the natural vernacular,‚Äù Cirne says. You know what he means. Fresher, brighter, crunchier wines. Cloudy pet-nats. Translucent Cab Francs. Orange wines that smell like Parmesan. Chuggable, chillable reds. Vin de soif, as Cirne puts it, rather than vin de garde: wine to quench the thirst, not wine for aging.Verjus, Cirne hopes, will be a place to engage with the best ‚Äî and in some cases, the highest end ‚Äî of this vernacular. Most wines fall in the $40 to $60 range. He has taken special care to showcase younger winemakers, especially iconoclasts within established regions: Fanny Sabre and Chapuis & Chapuis in Burgundy, Closeries de Mousses in Bordeaux. There‚Äôs lots of grower Champagne, including 25 selections under $100, and also less conventional bubbly: Fabio Gea‚Äôs Flowers in the Sky With Rain frizzante ($87); sparkling Sumoll from Clos Lentiscus in Spain ($55).The list is currently about 70 percent French, but Cirne says that‚Äôs likely to decrease as he builds up the representation from Oregon and California. The local-producer roster features some of our most hard-core naturalists: Martha Stoumen, Absentee, Hatton Daniels, Sonoma Mountain Winery.In any case, Verjus is more than a wine bar, natural or otherwise. It‚Äôs a wine shop, a retailer of specialty goods, a purveyor of Portuguese tinned fish and then some. The multipurpose model takes cues from the Parisian cave √° manger and the Catalonian pintxos bar: a casual retail-bar model that will interact with guests in different ways. ‚ÄúLike in a cave a manger, the idea is a solid wine program but with no pomposity, and no formal service,‚Äù says Cirne.You might enter Verjus, which occupies the former Chiaroscuro location on Washington Street, through the door that leads to the shop, in which case you‚Äôd see a table of books and periodicals for sale (Noble Rot magazine, ‚ÄúThe Dirty Guide to Wine‚Äù), alongside cases full of truffle shavers, decanters, pasta cutters and Town Cutler steak knives for sale. Across the room are shelves full of wine bottles, their prices marked on their necks in white chalk, flanking the ‚Äúconserva bar‚Äù ‚Äî a counter where servers will prepare simple plates centered around the imported tins of anchovies, mackerel and tuna from Lisbon, Portugal, company Tricana.Or you might enter Verjus from the other door, on the corner of Hotaling Place, in which case you‚Äôd find yourself in a wine bar with a chalkboard denoting by-the-glass pours and the current selection of charcuterie. Over the open kitchen hangs a marquee detailing Michael Tusk‚Äôs distinctly French menu ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking suckling pig ($19), pate en croute ($18) and escargot ($19). ‚ÄúEveryone thinks of chef as an Italophile,‚Äù Cirne says, ‚Äúbut actually he cooked in Provence before he cooked in Italy.‚ÄùYou might order a glass of Loire Valley ros√© or Spanish vermouth at the bar, though you‚Äôll get more bang for your buck if you wander over to the retail side of Verjus and snag a bottle from the shelf. Add a $20 corkage to the bottle‚Äôs marked price if you want to drink it here.Grab a seat if you can, or don‚Äôt: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping some people will be willing to eat standing up,‚Äù Cirne says. Verjus will not accept reservations. ‚ÄúThe onus is on the guest to get into the space and suss it out and move around, find out what‚Äôs on offer.‚ÄùThe freewheeling, versatile, insistently casual concept is certainly a departure for the Tusks, whose nearby Quince serves a $295 tasting menu and holds three Michelin stars, and whose Cotogna, though less formal, is still a sit-down restaurant with $34 entrees. The model has something in common with Shed, which recently closed in Healdsburg, and the forthcoming Boutique Crenn in Salesforce Tower.Is this cave √† manger-inspired creation becoming a Bay Area trend, then? Maybe (though Arlequin, for one, has been doing some version of it since the nineties). Maybe the popularity of this business model says something about the mounting labor and ingredient costs restaurants face here. Maybe it shows that restaurateurs are getting bored.Or maybe this cave √† manger-style situation is just perfectly suited to the style of wine that everyone suddenly seems to be drinking ‚Äî the style, if not precisely natural then in the natural vernacular, in which Verjus is specializing. The chillable, the chuggable, the crunchy. Even Cotogna, Cirne says, now has to have an orange wine available by the glass at all times. People ask for it.It‚Äôs not that plenty of other San Francisco bars and restaurants aren‚Äôt conversing in the natural vernacular already. In addition to the hardliner natural wine bars ‚Äî Punchdown, Ordinaire, Ruby ‚Äî Lord Stanley, High Treason, the Progress and many other forward-thinking establishments are speaking the language, or at least a dialect of it.But Verjus may come to signal an inflection point: the moment when the fine-dining establishment can no longer afford to ignore the movement."
81.0,Food,"If you asked San Francisco‚Äôs restaurant industry how it‚Äôs doing as 2018 begins, the answer might mirror your 85-year-old great-uncle‚Äôs: Not bad. Could be better.Consider the data that Yelp has provided on San Francisco restaurant openings and closures as a lab test. According to the San Francisco-based user-rating site, from last January through the end of November, 277 restaurants and food trucks in San Francisco opened, while 350 closed. The Yelp data also suggest that restaurants are feeling the impact of San Francisco‚Äôs rising minimum wage.In the broad spectrum of the city‚Äôs dining scene, data show that small restaurants ‚Äî the ones that specialize in banh mi, takeout General Tso‚Äôs chicken, eggs over easy ‚Äî made up the bulk of the business turnover in 2017. Most restaurants in this genre do not have liquor licenses, which can drive profits but are expensive to purchase. Such restaurants keep prices down for their customers. Their business depends on people who live around the block, those who wouldn‚Äôt Uber across town for a meal.Given that Yelp lists 4,785 open restaurants in San Francisco, a closure rate of 7.3 percent seems rather stable. ‚ÄúI believe we benefit from density, and the fact that we have full-blown neighborhoods,‚Äù said Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association.And yet the fact that closures outnumber openings seems significant, too. San Francisco‚Äôs 5.7 percent drop in the total number of restaurants mirrors what is happening nationwide: In February 2017, market research firm NPD reported that the number of independent restaurants in the United States decreased 4 percent from the year before.The city is experiencing a number of culinary shifts: While the ranks of Filipino, Korean and Hawaiian restaurants increased ‚Äî the poke boom is real ‚Äî restaurants tagged ‚Äúsandwiches,‚Äù ‚Äútraditional American‚Äù and ‚Äúburgers‚Äù fared the worst, closing at nearly double the rate that new ones opened.French and Italian restaurants in San Francisco showed steep declines as well. In particular, Italian restaurants closed at five times the rate they opened.Laurie Thomas, owner of the recently shuttered Rose Pistola and the still-open Terzo, credited the fact to a restaurant generational shift.‚ÄúItalian was one of the first cuisines to make it big. If you look back 25 years ago, there wasn‚Äôt as much sushi or other stuff then. Twenty years is a long time to have a restaurant,‚Äù Thomas said.The strengths, as well as the ills, of the restaurant industry are unevenly distributed across the city ‚Äî though not where people might expect. Hayes Valley, which many food publications have declared the buzziest restaurant neighborhood right now, is merely holding stable in terms of the number of restaurants. A few neighborhoods showed signs of very modest growth in 2017, including the Tenderloin, Noe Valley and Portola.But many other neighborhoods saw at least 30 percent more closures than openings, including the Mission, Union Square, North Beach, Bernal Heights, SoMa and Russian Hill.Debi Cohn, owner of a Mission bar named Asiento and director at large of the Mission Merchants Association, thinks oversaturation is partly to blame, especially in her neighborhood, which saw 25 openings and 38 closures.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that there are that many new customers to accommodate the new restaurant openings,‚Äù Cohn said. ‚ÄúPeople have children, move out of the area, work for companies that pay for food, and pay more in rent. I think the available pool of customers is the same. (The Mission) cannot support an additional 10 to 15 new restaurants.‚ÄùWith every neighborhood it‚Äôs possible to come up with theories for what is happening:The temporary shutdown of Moscone Center stripped SoMa restaurants of expense-account diners and might have been felt as far away as Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf; Port of San Francisco sales data confirm full-service restaurants on the Wharf saw a 5 to 11 percent drop from 2016 to 2017.Ripped-up roads and subway construction affected traffic in Union Square, Chinatown and North Beach.Thomas and several other industry people also said that the constant rain in early 2017 kept diners away.Yet openings and closures kept apace until June 2017, when closures flew upward like a kite caught by a gust of wind. The gust may have been the latest bump in San Francisco‚Äôs minimum wage, which rose from $13 an hour to $14 on July 1.‚ÄúPeople make business planning decisions when they have to do a minimum wage increase,‚Äù Borden said.Each increase doesn‚Äôt affect just workers at the bottom of the pay scale; workers paid above minimum wages often expect a bump in pay. A 2017 Harvard Business School study of Bay Area Yelp rankings found that after each $1 increase in the local minimum wage, restaurants with the average Yelp rating of 3.5 out of 5 were 14 percent more likely to close, and that closure risk rises as the stars drop.San Franciscans are still going out, flooding into new restaurants, keeping delivery drivers rushing from apartment to apartment. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely a slowing of consumer confidence,‚Äù Borden said. ‚ÄúThe popular places did fine, but for everybody else, the word I heard was that they just weren‚Äôt as busy as the year before.‚ÄùIn short: Not bad, but could be better."

119.0,Other,"Welcome to the 2017 edition of Bargain Chronicles, wherein we explore some of San Francisco's most delicious neighborhoods and choose our favorite meals that can be enjoyed for $20 and under.¬† Southern¬†flavors at Libby Jane   What: Egg and bacon ciabatta ($5.82), Natchitoches meat pie ($4.35)When: 7:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Mon.-Fri.; 9 a.m.-2 p.m. Sat.-Sun.As a Louisiana native, I can tell you there‚Äôs one thing in particular Southern people do after taking a bite of something delicious: They pause and take a long look at what they‚Äôre eating. It‚Äôs a moment of confusion, a silent pondering of how the universe can allow something simple to be, just for a second or two, breathtaking. If you want to live this Southern foodie moment, stroll down the 600 block of Polk Street, amble two doors past the popular Brenda‚Äôs to its coffee shop outpost, Libby Jane, and order an egg and bacon ciabatta breakfast sandwich. It‚Äôs simple with a fluffy egg and bacon skirting the edge of crispy and chewy, yet complex with a doughy ciabatta bun that‚Äôs both buttery and firm. Toss in a pretty phenomenal rendition of a Natchitoches meat pie where the spicy beef has a Cajun flair and consider that upbeat post-lunch feeling as lagniappe ‚Äî a Louisiana phrase meaning something extra you didn‚Äôt have to pay for (but probably should have).644 Polk St. (at Eddy); (415) 926-2540.Ethiopian lunch at Tadu   What: Special kitfo ($15.77)When: 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m. dailyBereft of time or place,  Ethiopian cuisine exists as both a bastion for vegetarians and an oasis for carnivores. It‚Äôs the culinary world‚Äôs chameleon, identifiable only by its kaleidoscopic plates like gomen bi sega (collard greens with lamb and onion) or even the spongy and slightly sour bread injera. The menu at Tadu is filled with the cuisine‚Äôs staples, and provides the neighborhood with a lunch destination capable of satisfying a swath of finicky eaters. The most popular dish at Tadu is the kitfo, or the ‚Äúspecial kitfo‚Äù as the restaurant calls it ‚Äî a sauteed concoction of ground beef, which can be ordered rare, medium rare or well done (go with medium rare), onions and jalape√±os.484 Ellis St. (at Leavenworth); (415) 409-6649. Late-night eats at Coco Bang   What: Kimchi fried rice ($11.91) or Korean fried chicken ($10.82)When: 5:30 p.m.-2 .a.m. Sun.-Thu., until 4 a.m. Fri.-Sat.Need a late-night hangout spot where the food comes out hot, quick and with just enough spice to soak up the bevy of drinks you imbibed between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.? Coco Bang can fill that role. Need a low-key midweek dinner before the sun sets in a place with a slightly hipster edge? Done and done. The kimchi fried rice is flavorful, but not overwhelming, topped with a fried egg that perfectly coats the bundles of sticky rice. Or maybe try the Korean fried chicken that‚Äôs crispy with a slight spiciness. Coco Bang will never be everything to everyone. But it can quell a hunger and maybe, just maybe, prevent a hangover.550 Taylor St. (at Post); (415) 292-5144. Vietnamese comfort food at Tuyet Mai  What: Com thit nuong, or grilled pork over rice ($7.40)When: 10 a.m.-8 p.m. daily.Tuyet Mai is one of those hidden spots that‚Äôs somehow more home than restaurant. The diners at any lunch service are mostly regulars who greet the shop‚Äôs diminutive staff before shuffling quickly to their favorite tables. It‚Äôs an unfussy and straightforward enterprise whose nature is reflected in its menu, a list with ample pho options (try the pho dac biet, or meatball soup, $8), and trumped only by a smattering of high-quality grilled-meat rice plates. Among those is Tuyet Mai‚Äôs com thit nuong ‚Äî an essential lunch order. The pork is grilled quickly with a slight char, seasoned with a bit of basil and mint, and then neatly laid over a bed of rice. Fast. Simple. Filling.547 Hyde St. (at Geary); (415) 931-4899. Thai halal food at Bang San   What: Pad thai $8.65, spring rolls (5 for $7.56) and Pra Ram chicken ($8.65)When: 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m. daily.Bang San, while not aesthetically the most unique food destination in the neighborhood, is organized, clean and somewhat faceless, embodying a certain mall food-court elegance. The menu is an accumulation of familiar Thai dishes done respectably. The pad thai isn‚Äôt a game-changer, but it is relatively flavorful with fresh, tender prawns and crisp green onion. Toss in a few hard-fried spring rolls and Bang San becomes a laudable lunchtime stop.791 O'Farrell St. (at Larkin); (415) 928-2772. Burrito at El Castillito   What: Carnitas super burrito ($10.86)Where: 10 a.m.-11:30 p.m. daily.It‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs errand to argue about the best burrito in San Francisco. Is it the award-winning La Taqueria? Or maybe Taqueria Canc√∫n ... or La Espiga De Oro ... or El Farolito? Solid options are endless. But in the Tenderloin, it‚Äôs safe to say El Castillito reigns, and rightfully so. Whether you‚Äôre a refried-beans fan or prefer the aesthetically pleasing layer of black beans; brown rice or no rice at all (gasp); steak or chicken; El Castillito has you covered. As for the shop‚Äôs pork carnitas option, not even the accoutrements of sliced avocado and spicy salsa can mask what is unquestionably true: El Castillito‚Äôs fame is based on the meticulous preparation of its meat. It may not be everyone‚Äôs go-to for burritos, but it stands alone in its neighborhood.370 Golden Gate Ave. (near Hyde); (415) 896-4570. Pho at Turtle Tower  What: Pho ga, or chicken noodle soup ($10.06; large is $11.69); them ga, or a side of steamed chicken ($4.73)When: 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Fri-Wed.It‚Äôs the aroma from Turtle Tower‚Äôs pho ga that hits you first. Pungent in the way that only North Vietnamese fare can be, it‚Äôs a nostril-searing moment of bliss when the restaurant‚Äôs chicken noodle option slides to rest on any table, let alone your own. The broth is a powerful, saliva-inducing mixture of slow-simmered spice elevated by cuts of green onion. With the wide noodles that soften as the bowl is consumed, Turtle Tower is a must for anyone interested in local pho. But be careful with your timing. The pho ga at Turtle Tower beckons us all, so seats are at a premium between noon and 2 p.m.645 Larkin St. (at Ellis); (415) 409-3333. Porchetta at Elmira   What: Porchetta sandwich ($13.05) and roasted potatoes ($3.81)When: 7:30 a.m.- 2:30 p.m. dailyElmira‚Äôs rotisserie pork sandwich with salsa rosso or salsa verde is served on a relatively sweet deli roll. Not only is the meat cooked to perfection, but it comes in hearty serving sizes ‚Äîa much-needed criteria for any respectable midday meal. And if the sandwich isn‚Äôt enough, Elmira‚Äôs roasted potatoes covered with what they call ‚Äúpork drippings‚Äù provide the perfect flourish. Rotisserie meat is having its moment, and as a San Francisco food-loving populace, we couldn‚Äôt be more lucky.154 McAllister St. (near Hyde); (415) 551-7332. Banh mi at Saigon SandwichWhat: Banh mi thit nuong ($4) and shrimp chips ($2)When: 7 a.m.-5:30 p.m. dailySaigon Sandwich is a place suspended in time, rooted not in San Francisco 2017, where a sandwich may run $16 on a good day. Instead it lives in an alternate reality in which an unquestionably amazing dish is consistently budget-friendly. The no-frills hole in the wall is far from a secret. Yet its pork banh mi remains a pleasant ham-fisted shot of authenticity in a food landscape that finds itself increasingly untethered from reality. Toss in a bag of shrimp chips for added crunch. But please, know your order before you get to the counter. There‚Äôs nothing more capable of anchoring a moment in the now than a mini riot because you held up the line.560 Larkin St. (at Eddy); (415) 474-5698.Essentially everything at Lee's SandwichesWhat: Vietnamese spring rolls ($6.51), hot wings (5 for $4.62)When: 8:30 a.m.-8 p.m. daily.If the Tenderloin outpost of Lee's Sandwiches were a piece of clothing, it'd be a unisex onesie. Lee's is a land of ubiquity, consciously specializing in anti-specialization. But that's the chain's charm, for the most part. Coconut waffles and iced lattes on the same wall-to-wall menu as banh mi, hot wings and eggrolls is almost endearing, albeit a little dizzying. While the banh mi is popular, it's the chain's random dishes that are capable of stealing the show. The shrimp, taro and pork eggrolls, for example, are crunchy and pleasantly flavorful, just like Lee's hot wings.625 Larkin St. (at Willow); (415) 929-6888.

142.0,Food,"Redwood City‚Äôs Impossible Foods announced Thursday that it has switched to a ‚Äúversion 2.0‚Äù of its meatless Impossible Burger, six weeks after El Segundo‚Äôs Beyond Meat introduced a new version of the plant-based Beyond Burger at Carl‚Äôs Jr. locations around the country.As the competition builds, the question becomes: Which tastes better? At back-to-back tastings at Carl‚Äôs Jr. and Gott‚Äôs Roadside, which has sold the Impossible Burger 2.0 since mid-January, the two new versions demonstrated they tasted dramatically different from versions 1.0 ‚Äî and from each other.The Carl‚Äôs Jr. Beyond Burger ($9.49) greeted the nose with a swaggering smokiness and beef-like aroma that hit hard and lingered long. Prepared by the fast-food chain, its porous texture resembled that of the McRib, McDonald‚Äôs cult pressed-pork sandwich; the burger will eventually replace the version sold at grocery stores, allowing home cooks to pan-sear or grill it, which gives the non-meat a crust that only benefits its flavor.Gott‚Äôs Impossible Burger ($12.99) profited from the advantage of a brioche bun and higher-caliber fixings. The patty, which formerly tasted like wheat gluten spritzed with coconut oil and beef bouillon, now better mimics a real hamburger in its texture, its beefy flavor far more amplified. It looks and tastes like a lite hamburger, but a hamburger nonetheless.If you want to try the new Beyond Burger, it has made its debut in 1,000 campus food-service operations as well as 1,000 locations of Carl‚Äôs Jr., including all of the stores in the greater Bay Area. Search for the one nearest you at www.carlsjr.com/locations.Feb. 7 is the first day that all restaurants will be able to order the new Impossible Burger, so it will take several weeks for the recipe to become widely available. If you want to taste the new version now, Impossible Foods has posted a map of the 120 locations that currently serve it at www.impossiblefoods.com/newrecipe. San Francisco locations include Gott‚Äôs at the Ferry Building, Mendocino Farms, and the two restaurants that introduced the West Coast to the burger, Jardiniere and Cockscomb."
109.0,Food,"This is A Million Plates, the Chronicle‚Äôs regular column about immigrant food in the Bay Area, centered around the theory that there are a million different plates of food eaten every day in this region.To Doris Farias, 60, and her daughter Siury Pulgar, 39, Christmas is a time for hallacas. And hallacas means it‚Äôs time for La Fiesta de Las Hallacas.For Farias, it‚Äôs a favorite memory of her Venezuelan childhood, a time when her mom, aunts, uncles and cousins would sleep over at her grandmother‚Äôs home and have a hallaca-making party, cooking all night. It‚Äôs a tradition she passed on to her daughter and has now brought all the way to south San Jose to share with her young granddaughters.Hallacas are often called Venezuelan tamales because both have corn doughs stuffed with a filling, then wrapped in banana leaves. Both are labor-intensive and best made in the company of family and friends. But that‚Äôs where the similarities end. While a Mexican tamale is all thick dough with a little filling, a hallaca is a thin dough wrapped around a good amount of guiso, a filling traditionally made with meat (beef, pork or chicken) cooked with onions, peppers, olives, capers and raisins. Mexican tamales are steamed, while hallacas are wrapped in a banana leaf painted with bright orange annatto-infused oil and then boiled.‚ÄúThe olives, capers and raisins ‚Äî that‚Äôs what makes it taste like Christmas,‚Äù Pulgar says.In the center of her daughter‚Äôs large kitchen, Farias is surrounded by family and friends chatting happily in Spanish as they all sip chicha de arroz, a rich and drinkable Venezuelan rice pudding. She‚Äôs been prepping for days. Her two guisos ‚Äî one chicken, one vegetable ‚Äî have been cooked and cooled. Her dough has been made, thanks to a combination of Harina P.A.N., water, a little sugar and juices from the guiso. The banana leaves have been washed and cut, and the annatto oil infused.She lines people up into an assembly line around the kitchen island and puts on an apron adorned with the yellow, blue and red Venezuelan flag. Using her hand, she flattens a small dough ball on top of a banana leaf, then tops it with plastic wrap and expertly presses a small cutting board on top until she has an even, thin circle. She passes the dough to her left, where the next person spoons guiso into the center, and tops it with raw slices of bell pepper and onion. It‚Äôs passed again, and the next person uses the banana leaf to help fold the dough around the guiso, then folds up the banana leaf and wraps it with a string.This is truly Farias‚Äô happy place. Her daughter, Pulgar, immigrated to the U.S. in 2003 for school, married an Indian immigrant and had two daughters. Pulgar moved her parents to the U.S. in late 2015 when it became too dangerous for them to stay in Venezuela. Since Hugo Chavez became president in 1999, the country has suffered from hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, power cuts and organized crime. Farias left all of her family and friends in Macuto, Vargas, Venezuela, just 45 minutes away from Caracas, the country‚Äôs capital. She constantly worries about their lack of access to basic human rights and their safety, as does everyone else at the party.That‚Äôs why so many Venezuelans are leaving their country, she says ‚Äî 2.3 million since 2014, according to the British Broadcasting Corp. The guests at the party, many who also immigrated to the U.S. from Venezuela in the last two decades, concur, sharing their own experiences.‚ÄúEven if they have money, they can‚Äôt get the basics, and things like electricity, water and gas can be shut off at anytime,‚Äù says Joaquin Delgado, who left in the ‚Äò90s for school in Japan and moved to New York for work in 2000. His family remains in Venezuela, and he tries to help by sending his relatives on trips outside of the country,and shipping them foodFarias fights those hard feelings by cooking and inviting people over. ‚ÄúPreparing the traditional foods of Venezuela is one way of staying connected with my roots and my people, my childhood and my traditions,‚Äù she says in Spanish, as translated by her daughter. ‚ÄúTo me, cooking is a way to share love and to communicate with others.‚ÄùThat mission has recently translated to her new food company named Galip√°n Catering, which mostly caters to the local Venezuelan community. Farias, who used to sell healthy versions of Venezuelan food and whole wheat bread at home, even decided to offer a full Venezuelan Christmas meal ‚Äî hallacas, pan de jamon and torta negra (a fruit cake with chocolate and rum). Pulgar helps out, and Venezuelans drive from all over Northern California to buy her food.Pulgar also carries fond memories of La Fiesta de Las Hallacas. Every holiday and Christmas, her family would gather at her grandma‚Äôs house and make 200 to 300 hallacas over the course of three days. ‚ÄúMy cousins and I would make our own mud hallacas in the yard, with pebbles for the olives and raisins,‚Äù she says. One of those cousins is living in Germany as a political refugee. He‚Äôs a journalist who wrote about the Venezuelan government, Pulgar says, which means it‚Äôs no longer safe for him to live there.The truth is that a party like this has become a luxury for most Venezuelans. ‚ÄúThis could never happen back home. There is no way they could get all of this food,‚Äù Pulgar says. ‚ÄúWe just shipped a few boxes full of food to some families back home so they can have a Christmas meal.‚ÄùWhile the hallacas boil, Delgado sits down at the table with a cuatro, a Venezuelan guitar similar to a ukulele, and starts playing and singing songs. His wife, Delhy Saggese, grabs a drum and sets it between her legs, using chunky sticks to tap out a beat. Another guest, Chiquy Mejia, starts dancing, and then Delgado and Saggese‚Äôs teen daughter, Isabella, joins. Most of the women follow.Mejia, a dance instructor, puts on a song called ‚ÄúPa‚Äô Venezuela‚Äù by Max Pizzolante, and explains the relevance of the tune: ‚ÄúThis is a song with a very important message. It‚Äôs telling the bad people to get out of Venezuela.‚Äù Mejia leads them in an energetic choreographed dance, moving in sync with the drum beats as the rest of the guests clap and cheer.It‚Äôs a lively and upbeat song, talking about Venezuela‚Äôs difficult situation. It‚Äôs a study in juxtaposition, much like this party, a mix of sadness, frustration and the hopefulness of a people. As the ending chorus plays, the entire group is singing together, saying the words ‚Äúfuera!‚Äù (out!) over and over.To those who don‚Äôt love you, OUT!To those who disrespect you, OUT!To those who mistreat you, OUT!To those who take advantage, OUT!And the last line: ‚ÄúMi Venezuela pronto vas a sonre√≠r otra vez.‚Äù My Venezuela, soon you will smile again.To place an order with Galip√°n Catering, email Galipan.catering@gmail.com or call 650-761-1695.

74.0,Food," Welcome to the 2017 edition of Bargain Chronicles, wherein we explore some of San Francisco's most delicious neighborhoods and choose our favorite meals that can be enjoyed for $20 and under. See also: Chinatown, the Inner Richmond, the Tenderloin, Bernal Heights and the Mission's 24th Street. Rectangle slices at The Den What: Pizza for you ($3) + pizza for someone else ($3)When: 7 a.m.-5 p.m. Mon. and Wed.-Fri.; 8 a.m.-2 p.m. Sat.-Sun. Note: Pizza after 10:30 a.m.The Bayview‚Äôs food options are largely found on Third Street, though a few gems are scattered about the industrial area that encompasses the main commercial corridor. The Den is one of these outliers, dropped on a seemingly random corner. It is an outgrowth of popular patisserie Craftsman & Wolves, whose commissary kitchen lies behind the cafe. Many of the outfit‚Äôs signature baked goods are on offer, including the signature Rebel Within, but a daily changing square slice of pizza is the lunch order here, be it the Canadian bacon/mushrooms/green onions combo or a zucchini/ricotta number on Wednesdays. If you want to pay it forward, you can also prepay for slices for less-fortunate folks: These offerings appear in the window, up for grabs in the form of Post-it notes.1598 Yosemite Ave. (at Keith); (415) 423-3337.  www.craftsman-wolves.com Barbecue at Smokin‚Äô WarehouseWhat: Beef ribs platter ($16.50)When: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Mon.-Fri.One doesn‚Äôt simply walk into Smokin‚Äô Warehouse. This is largely because Smokin‚Äô Warehouse is only a window ‚Äî no door, no tables ‚Äî so it is literally impossible to walk into Smokin‚Äô Warehouse. Also, meat-seekers must place orders (via phone) at least a day ahead so that enough meat can be smoked for everyone. The barbecue stands up to anyone else‚Äôs in San Francisco, but the real reason to go is the presence of Wagyu beef ribs. It‚Äôs rare to see beef ribs on any local menu; the Smokin‚Äô Warehouse version ‚Äî a Flintstonian cut, big as a forearm and utterly delightful in its primordial tenderness ‚Äî will reveal what we‚Äôre missing. It alone is worth the trip.1465 Carroll Ave. (at Jennings); (415) 648-8881. Stories at Radio Africa What: Green lentils ($10) + Laughing Monk beer ($5)When: 12 p.m.-2:30 p.m., 5:30 p.m.-8 p.m., Mon.-Fri.When Eskender Aseged opened a brick-and-mortar location of his popular pop-up restaurant, way back in 2012, it was heralded as the first in a wave of new restaurants for the area. That movement has been slower to materialize, but Radio Africa has maintained and evolved, continually adjusting its menu and prices. Yet the green lentils, in some form, have been with Aseged the whole time,  even back to his pop-up days. Now served with rice, greens and roasted vegetables, the dish is a perfect window in Aseged‚Äôs story, a blend of Africa (his homeland), the Mediterranean (his past restaurant experience) and California (his present). Pair with a beer brewed down the block at Laughing Monk for an extra taste of the Bayview.4800 Third St. (at Oakdale); (415) 420-2486. Banh mi at Duc Loi Pantry What: Banh Mi Vietnam ($6.99)When: 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Mon.-Sat., 9 a.m.-8 p.m. Sun.Duc Loi is known to most San Franciscans as the supermarket on the corner of Mission and 18th streets. Smart eaters also know that within Duc Loi lies a sandwich counter that produces some of the city‚Äôs best banh mi. As such, it‚Äôs a fortuitous twist that the Duc Loi folks opened a Bayview spinoff, complete with the same banh mi menu. Led by the Banh Mi Vietnam, a mass of tender roast pork, pink barbecued pork and earthy pate, Duc Loi‚Äôs sandwiches are meaty and girthy, a far cry from the thinner pickle-and-cilantro heavy numbers you may find elsewhere. Save half for lunch tomorrow.5900 Third St. (at Carroll); (415) 349-4988. Fried chicken at Frisco FriedWhat: 3-piece chicken dinner ($15.99)When: 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Mon.-Thu., until 9 p.m. Fri.; noon-9 p.m. Sat., and until 7 p.m. Sun.Third Street is littered with fried chicken options, but unlike most that display their precooked wares behind a glass window, Frisco Fried cooks its birds to order. Owner Marcel Banks has gotten plenty of love for his ‚ÄúSan Francisco-style soul food‚Äù ‚Äî and for good reason. Yes, you‚Äôll have to wait a little longer, and you might pay a little more than the shop down the block, it‚Äôs worth it: Frisco Fried remains a gold standard for fried chicken.5176 Third St. (at Thornton); (415) 822-1517 or www.friscofried.biz Krispy Krunchy Chicken Tacos (?!)What: Fried chicken tacos (two for $4.50)When: Lunch and dinner dailyIt makes no sense, but it makes sense. The best tacos in the neighborhood might just be found improbably ‚Ä¶ within a SuperSave supermarket ... at a counter technically run by a fried-chicken chain from Louisiana. To the usual Krispy Krunchy menu ‚Äî a Popeye‚Äôs-esque collection of fried chicken, biscuits and such ‚Äî this outpost‚Äôs workers have tacked on makeshift options of tacos, quesadillas and burritos. And yes, they are made with the very same fried chicken, crisp and heavily seasoned with the same spicy-salty mix. The tacos are served in the taco truck style ‚Äî two corn tortillas spartanly topped with chopped meat and garnished with onions, cilantro and salsa.4517 Third St. (at La Salle); (415) 874-9463 or www.krispykrunchy.com Plate lunch at Huli HuliWhat: BBQ mixed plate with kimchi fried rice ($11.75) + shave ice for dessert ($3.50)When: 7 a.m.-3 p.m. Mon.-Fri.Even with the best intentions, it‚Äôs rare that a new restaurant can instantly feel like part of a neighborhood, especially an area with as deep roots as the Bayview. But Huli Huli is invested in its community, and vice versa. This is because of owner Shawn Gordon, a Hunters Point native who leads Project Bayview, a transitional-housing program. Huli Huli serves up Hawaiian food in the morning (loco moco, breakfast burritos) and afternoon, when a medley of hefty plate lunches ($6.25-$10.25) takes over the menu. Always, though, finish with a massive shave ice.4100 Third St. (at Hudson); (415) 970-1990 or  www.hulihulisf.comAl fresco pie at All Good PizzaWhat: Margherita ($11) + lemonade ($3)When: 10:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Mon.-Fri. and 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sat.-Sun.With a sprawling, sunny picnic area and affordable pizza, salads and sandwiches, All Good Pizza is a unicorn ‚Äî not only in the Bayview, but in the entire city. As such, the place feels like a nice escape from everyday life, a lunchtime destination where families, friends and nearby workers converge for brief pizza respite, which is really the best kind of respite. Oh, and the pies ‚Äî with fresh ingredients and thin cracker crusts, more Roman style than Neapolitan ‚Äî live up to the titular billing, too.1605 Jerrold Ave. (at Third); (415) 933-9384 or www.allgoodpizza.com Soul food at Auntie April‚ÄôsWhat: 2 piece chicken-and-waffles ($11)When: 8 a.m.-4 p.m. daily.At Auntie April‚Äôs, chicken and waffles is on the marquee, and for good reason. Owner April Spears has perfected her signature ‚Äî the chicken is delicately fried to order, linked together through syrup to its waffle cohort, crisp and chewy with a hint of sweetness. The rest of the menu can be explored, too, but why not stick to the greatest hits?4618 Third St. (near McKinnon); (415) 643-4983 or www.auntieaprilsf.com Comida Hondurena at Las Isletas What: Tacos Hondurena ($10)When: 10 a.m.-9 p.m. daily.Las Isletas has been serving the Bayview for three decades. About 10 years ago, Nubia Miranda and her family took over operations, and the lunchtime crowds attest to its appeal. Las Isletas serves straightforward Mexican fare, but its strength lies in its Central American dishes ‚Äî the Honduran, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan specialties. The Honduran tacos ‚Äî rolled and fried tortillas of chicken ‚Äî will haunt your cravings, though indecisive eaters should opt for the Plato Tipico Salvadoreno ($18.95), a gargantuan collection of pupusas, pastels, chicharrons, tamals and yucca fries.4508 Third St. (near McKinnon); (415) 643-4436 or or www.lasisletasrestaurant.com Paolo Lucchesi is the food editor of the San Francisco Chronicle.

108.0,Other,"Bar Crenn calls itself a wine bar. Is it, though?On one hand, it looks like a bar. There are no tablecloths. The lighting is dim. The food is mostly bite-size.On the other hand, it feels like a fancy restaurant. Reservations are encouraged. Service is formal. Oh, and it‚Äôs expensive. Shockingly ‚Äî possibly even traumatically ‚Äî expensive. My bill for two people was over $400.We didn‚Äôt even get a bottle.Let me be clear: I‚Äôm not opposed to spending money on good food and wine. Judging from how busy many of our city‚Äôs upscale restaurants are, neither are many of you. In fact, a truly great experience in a restaurant or bar is one of the things I‚Äôm happiest to splurge on.So what bothers me about Bar Crenn is not simply the sticker price. What bothers me is the strange incongruity between what it purports to be ‚Äî a casual living room hangout‚Äî and what it is. What bothers me is that the gap between expectation and reality, for a visitor, is so wide that it feels downright blindsiding.Take, for example, the reservation system. Bar Crenn reservations are available on Tock, the ticketing service used by restaurants like the French Laundry, Saison and Single Thread. You can book a caviar tasting ($165), the ‚Äúcarte blanche‚Äù tasting menu ($85), a reservation deposit ($50) or a counter deposit ($50). I admit I found the differences between these designations confusing, especially since Bar Crenn‚Äôs website has no menu and, therefore, no prices listed. Why were some of these options tickets, and others merely deposits? How much could I expect to spend on food? What was the ‚Äúcarte blanche‚Äù menu? Did the ‚Äúcounter‚Äù option signify a more formal experience, like a chef‚Äôs table, or a less formal experience, like sitting at the bar? Did any of them include drinks? (No.)It‚Äôs confusing. But here‚Äôs what you need to know: All of the Tock tickets serve as deposits and will be subtracted from your check. Don‚Äôt expect that the ticket price will reflect your final bill, or even your food cost.Despite the formality of the ticketing system, the space itself is a lounge. The seating options, apart from the white pelt-capped barstools along the marble bar, consist of hulking armchairs and cushy couches situated around coffee tables. Baroque chandeliers, built-in bookshelves and throw blankets draped over chair backs (more white pelts) add to the feeling that you‚Äôre in the living room of your quirky Francophile great-aunt. You wouldn‚Äôt mistake it for a restaurant, especially not for Atelier Crenn, located right next door.The style of cuisine is different here from Atelier Crenn and Petit Crenn, the chef‚Äôs two other San Francisco restaurants. Here, most of the dishes have been borrowed from famous French chefs, and the food is old-school ‚Äî the sort that‚Äôs not afraid of cream or offal. In many cases the dishes are so rich that they seem quaint: A recent menu included potee de cochon, pig trotters in broth (attributed to chef Arnault Lallement; $24), and cromesquis, pork croquettes with black truffle (Sylvestre Wahid; $10).Wine director Matt Montrose has assembled a French-focused list, especially strong in Burgundy, with a healthy dose of California and a sprinkling of other European wines. The Southern Hemisphere is absent. Twenty wines are offered by the glass, ranging from $15 (Lodi Graciano from Sheldon winery) to $50 (Krug Grand Cuvee Champagne). On the whole, it‚Äôs a good by-the-glass list, if weighted toward the higher end of the price spectrum. Many pours represent lesser-known producers from better-known regions, which I appreciate: Chateau Larruau from Margaux, in Bordeaux; La Raimbauderie from Sancerre, in the Loire Valley.Happily, there are some wild cards. A cuvee called Recto/Verso ($20/glass), from Domaine des Accoles in the Ardeche region of southeast France, is a still blanc de noirs of Grenache, blended with a little bit of the white grape Clairette. It‚Äôs a fascinating wine, tactile and leesy, giving a whiff of Parmesan rind. From Samuel Tinon, a French-born winemaker working in Hungary, is a rendition of H√°rslevel≈± ($16/glass), a variety typically used for Tokaji dessert wines. Though dry, it carries many of the rich, honeyed tones typical of Tokaji, with a mineral tone, reminiscent of white ash.In other words, it‚Äôs possible at Bar Crenn to discover something new, delicious, unexpected ‚Äî as it should be at any competent wine bar. And yet this sense of discovery feels dampened by the unnecessary formality of the Bar Crenn experience.The ‚Äúliving room‚Äù concept feels hamstrung given how expensive and utensil-intensive the food is. A $32 serving of quenelles Lyonnaises, for example, mounds of seafood mousse in a crayfish-cream sauce, does not lend itself easily to a bar format. Nor does the three-course tasting menu, which on a recent evening included a dish of crab encased in thin avocado slices, and an egg and bone marrow custard, topped with caviar and served inside its shell. Barring the mignardises that come for dessert, it all required silverware.You might, as I did, find it a little bit excruciating to be leaning forward from the very edge of your cavernous armchair, slouching down to reach your knife and fork to the coffee table, whose surface was roughly level with my knees. If I am paying $85 for a meal, should I have to slouch to eat it?Even from a lauded chef like Dominique Crenn, $85 is a lot for three small courses; if you‚Äôre hungry, it won‚Äôt feel like dinner. The suggested pairings with the tasting menu will run you $65. On a recent visit, the pairings included a German Weissburgunder (elsewhere known as Pinot Blanc), a Sancerre ros√© of Pinot Noir and a dessert wine from France‚Äôs Juran√ßon made from botrytized Petit Manseng. Interesting? Sure. Were those three pours worth $65? No.Was this simply a matter of mismanaged expectations? For instance, if Bar Crenn had been billed as a Dominique Crenn restaurant, rather than as a wine bar, would it have felt less jarring? Maybe. But even within the limited universe of Dominique Crenn, the Bar Crenn menus do not represent good value: At Petit Crenn, the chef‚Äôs Hayes Valley restaurant, the six-course tasting menu runs $95, and the wine pairings $70 ‚Äî just $10 and $5 more than at Bar Crenn. Petit Crenn restaurant has an excellent wine list, overseen now by Mikayla Cohen. Its menu constitutes a full meal, and a beautiful one ‚Äî one I‚Äôve paid for before and would happily pay for again.I left Bar Crenn with a lingering question: Do San Francisco diners really want an elevated version of every type of experience?At some point, the very elements that let Bar Crenn pass as a wine bar ‚Äî the coffee tables, the light bites ‚Äî start to feel like a rip-off. I‚Äôd rather drink great wine in a legitimately casual setting, as is possible in so many San Francisco bars. Barring that, I‚Äôd rather spend my money on an actual, proper meal.Esther Mobley is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs wine, beer and spirits writer.

23.0,Other,"WASHINGTON ‚Äî A government funding deal that passed Congress late Thursday would block federal officers from arresting undocumented immigrants solely because they come forward to take in migrant children.The constraint on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency comes after The Chronicle reported that the government had made scores of such arrests ‚Äî including more than 100 people who were taken into custody from July through November despite having no criminal record. Immigrant and child welfare advocates had assailed the practice as endangering young people by keeping them in detention longer and by giving immigrants an incentive to conceal potential sponsors‚Äô true identities.The population of undocumented children in government custody skyrocketed to record levels as immigration officials investigated the potential sponsors.The ban on arresting sponsors with no criminal record is included in a bill to fund roughly one-quarter of the government through September. The appropriations legislation is the product of weeks of intense negotiations to avert a repeat of the partial shutdown that began Dec. 22 and lasted 35 days.The Senate and House both passed the bill Thursday, and the White House said President Trump would sign it.House Democrats pushed strongly for the provision during negotiations over the funding package, said a Democratic aide who was not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz offered the specific legislative language.‚ÄúArresting potential sponsors only ensures that children who flee dangerous circumstances will languish longer in overly crowded detention facilities,‚Äù Wasserman Schultz said. ‚ÄúDemocrats agree, this cruel, immoral Trump trap does nothing to make America safer.‚ÄùAt issue is the process of finding homes for undocumented immigrant children who come to the U.S. by themselves or are separated from an adult at the border.Those children end up detained in a national network of shelters until they can be released to an adult, usually a relative. The shelters are designed to be a temporary bridge for often-traumatized children to more stable homes, in which they can pursue their case to stay in the country legally.To sponsor a child, adults have long had to go through background checks for any criminal history or other red flags that might endanger the child. Immigration status is not weighed as a risk factor.But last year the Trump administration added additional layers of review, including working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to run fingerprints of potential sponsors. That caused concern within the immigrant community that sponsors, many of whom are undocumented themselves, could be ensnared in the administration‚Äôs no-limits immigration enforcement. The revelation that ICE had in turn used that information to arrest potential sponsors, most of whom had no criminal record, confirmed that fear.Under the administration‚Äôs policies, the number of children in custody reached nearly 15,000, breaking records even after the government halted the practice it implemented last spring of separating families at the border. In December, the Department of Health and Human Services stopped requiring that every additional adult in a sponsor‚Äôs home be fingerprinted, a practice that had greatly slowed the process, keeping children detained longer. Since then, the number of children in custody has dropped to 11,500.The government funding bill bars the administration from detaining or moving to deport undocumented immigrants based solely on information provided by Health and Human Services, which runs the unaccompanied children program, unless it provides evidence of a past child abuse-related felony or potential human trafficking."

For the sauce and pasta: Butter a 4-quart casserole or 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Melt the butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. When the butter just starts to bubble, whisk in the flour. Cook until it begins to smell nutty, about 2-3 minutes, whisking constantly. Slowly whisk in the milk and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring constantly to prevent scorching, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and gradually whisk in the cheeses. Add the salt, pepper and cayenne, and stir until smooth. Adjust seasoning to taste, if needed.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni until just al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.In a large bowl, combine the pasta, reserved pasta water and sauce until the noodles are well coated. Fold in the Spam mixture."

Editor‚Äôs note: Drink Up, The Chronicle‚Äôs guide to where you should be drinking in the Bay Area, is evolving into a column with multiple voices. Chronicle wine, beer and spirits writer Esther Mobley, who has written the column for the last three years, will continue to contribute reviews. She‚Äôs now joined by two talented San Francisco writers: Maggie Hoffman, former drinks editor at Serious Eats and author of ‚ÄúThe One-Bottle Cocktail‚Äù; and Emma Silvers, an arts and pop-culture writer who was formerly music editor at KQED. Our hope is that together, these three writers‚Äô voices can tell a complete story of the way we drink in the Bay Area today. .Schmidt‚Äôs Pub doesn‚Äôt officially open until noon, but around 11:30 you‚Äôll start to see the regulars. About a half-dozen people, mostly older folks, are the first customers at the offbeat, antiques-packed Albany tavern every day. They trickle in as soon as the door is unlocked, then stay for an hour or two amid the bookshelves and board games in the converted Craftsman. If the weather‚Äôs nice, they sit outside.The pub keeps Old Speckled Hen on tap for one of these patrons, who orders a daily half-pint. Another regular, a locally beloved dancer and rare-book collector named Stuart Teitler, died in 2012 ‚Äî but he‚Äôs still a fixture at Schmidt‚Äôs, thanks to the glass case that displays his dancing shoes and hat. During the month of February,  there is a black cloth over the display, to which an employee has taped a piece of paper with the words ‚Äú‚ÄòBecause, f‚Äî February!‚Äô ‚Äî Stuart.‚Äù‚ÄúThat was Stuart,‚Äù says John Schmidt, 75, the pub‚Äôs owner and patriarch, an hour before opening on a recent Sunday. ‚ÄúHe really hated February.‚ÄùFounded in 1978 on Solano Avenue near the Albany-Berkeley border, the pub ‚Äî or Schmidt‚Äôs Tobacco Trading Co. & Pub, if you‚Äôd like to immediately out yourself as a nonlocal ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt take credit cards. Transactions are recorded by pen on steno pad. Available for purchase are eight draft beers (always Guinness, Fuller‚Äôs ESB, Scrimshaw Pilsner and the aforementioned Hen; Racer 5, a couple Belgians and Fieldwork‚Äôs St. Thomas IPA rounded out the taps on my last visit). Then there are around 30 beers in bottles, coffee and tea, and a dozen wines by the glass.But the pub‚Äôs most noteworthy offering, perhaps, isn‚Äôt potable. In a time and region where the concept of a smoking section is pass√© at best, Schmidt‚Äôs proudly offers nearly two dozen hand-labeled glass jars of fragrant Dutch, English and American tobacco, for both pipes and roll-your-own cigarettes. Peruse the converted gun case stuffed with antique pipes and flasks for sale, if you‚Äôre feeling Hemingway-esque. But simple rolling papers (75 cents each) are also plenty popular, thanks to the spacious front patio, a sturdy thing festooned with Christmas lights ‚Äî and, on a warm Saturday evening, teeming with people.If it‚Äôs cold, Schmidt‚Äôs interior offers a fireplace flanked by armchairs, wood tables topped with green glass bankers‚Äô lamps, and a grandfather clock that hasn‚Äôt worked in years. This tchotchke-stuffed seating area is often overseen by a big black dog named Phoebe, who can usually be found lying on the floor. You‚Äôre welcome to bring your own dog, as well as your own food. But there‚Äôs no Wi-Fi, so don‚Äôt ask.‚ÄúWhen I was in corporate life, there weren‚Äôt any calculators. I used a slide rule. So I was very used to doing graphs, manual stuff,‚Äù says Schmidt, a native of Los Angeles who studied and taught at the University of Washington before becoming an economist with Kaiser Engineers in the Bay Area. Although over the years his son and other employees have begged him to let them update the back end of the business, Schmidt still does the accounting, and he still does it by hand.‚ÄúI have a computer and a cell phone and all that, but I‚Äôve never felt particularly comfortable or interested in it,‚Äù he says, at the prospect of a digital upgrade. Besides: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always felt a place like this doesn‚Äôt need it.‚ÄùBy ‚Äúa place like this,‚Äù Schmidt means a watering hole in the spirit of old English and Irish taverns, like the ones he fell for as a young man on business trips to the United Kingdom. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre more about the place than the beer: There‚Äôs music, people telling stories and then you have grandma knitting over there,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just loved them.‚ÄùPub life also turned out to be a sweet spot for the businessman, who always admired Jack London‚Äôs pursuit of varied interests. When his engineering firm closed in the early ‚Äô70s, Schmidt decided he was tired of corporate life. He‚Äôd always had an eye for antiques, so he began buying them at markets, refurbishing and selling them out of a co-op just up the block on Solano, in what‚Äôs now a tapas restaurant. He also indulged his love of tobacco (an affinity he picked up in grad school, where ‚Äúprofessors always had pipes‚Äù) and eventually opened a small trading post farther up the street, in what‚Äôs now a wine bar.But in 1978, the building at 1492 Solano became available ‚Äî when, according to Schmidt, former Albany Mayor Jerome Blank offered to trade him the ‚Äúderelict‚Äù house in a business district in exchange for the small home Schmidt owned in a residential one. (Blank was a well-known developer, Rotary Club president and philanthropist; he‚Äôs still known, some 17 years after his death, as ‚ÄúMr. Albany.‚Äù He is a story, perhaps, for another time.)Schmidt couldn‚Äôt say no. He moved in his antiques and tobacco. He rebuilt the front and back decks, installed linoleum floors near the bar. He put in two taps (John Courage and Henry Weinhard‚Äôs) and set up the sign out front (Schmidt‚Äôs Tobacco Trading Co. & Pub, until he could decide on a real name).Then he promptly began losing money, he says with a laugh. He was 35, and he was the sole employee.Forty years later, Schmidt‚Äôs has stayed afloat, to say the least ‚Äî though considering the craft beer boom and the rate at which new bars and restaurants have sprung up in this area, staying afloat is maybe saying a lot. A few blocks away on Gilman, Westbrae Biergarten offers kid-friendly outdoor seating with heat lamps, rotating local taps and Brazilian-inspired salads and sandwiches. On San Pablo, the Albany Taproom slings gourmet burgers alongside 30-plus draft beers in a slick stainless-steel setting. Meanwhile, the Hotsy Totsy, a quintessential Albany dive bar from 1939, was reborn in 2009 as a hipster hangout with a gin program. (This is no slight to these establishments, mind you ‚Äî especially not to Hotsy Totsy co-owner and Bar Star Jessica Maria. Her cocktails are excellent.)But for now, the march of time seems to have skipped Schmidt‚Äôs altogether. And once you spend an afternoon at the pub, you‚Äôll see why its proprietor isn‚Äôt worried about the competition. Discriminating smokers are, understandably, drawn to the place. But there‚Äôs also a built-in, intergenerational clientele: Schmidt himself met his wife, Peggy, at the pub, when she asked him to dance at a party in 1987 ‚Äî the old Irishmen in the black-and-white photos on the walls are primarily her family ‚Äî but he‚Äôs quick to add that they‚Äôre one of ‚Äúprobably hundreds‚Äù of couples who met here. He knows, because those couples‚Äô kids are grown-ups now, and come in to tell him.As with any cult favorite worth its salt,  fandom is spread by word of mouth (Schmidt‚Äôs internet presence is minimal at best), and many patrons think of the place as their secret (someone will likely be displeased with this story). But its lore has traveled. In 1995, Schmidt received in the mail a signed copy of ‚ÄúThe Great Good Place,‚Äù the influential book by sociologist Ray Oldenburg that argues for the importance of ‚Äúthe third place‚Äù: the cafes, barbershops and watering holes that bring people together outside of work and their homes. ‚ÄúJohn, my friend Peter Apanel says you have a ‚Äòwonderful‚Äô place, and that‚Äôs high praise,‚Äù inscribed Oldenburg, who lives in Florida. ‚ÄúHope to enjoy one day!‚ÄùLate-morning sunlight is now streaming through windows onto the hardwood floors as, an hour before opening, the pub fills slowly with people, sounds, the smell of coffee. First Peggy breezes in with a laundry basket under one arm. Then longtime employee Phil Ramey arrives for the opening shift, gingerly stepping over Phoebe to wipe down tables, and prepping the espresso machine, pausing to demonstrate how it‚Äôs tricked out with an antique train whistle. (Ramey picked up the whistle a few years back, but couldn‚Äôt quite figure out a practical use for it, so lattes now come with optional atmospheric railroad sounds.)Ramey can tell you about how the pub is a clubhouse for staff, as well. Schmidt likes to hire students, artists and musicians as part-timers; he currently employs nine. Their friends become regulars, and over time they all become kin, which accounts for the wide age range of the average customer. (When I mention a high school classmate who worked here more than 10 years ago, Peggy delivers a full report on his family and theater career up in Ashland, Ore.) On a nearby shelf is a photograph of a regular who died too young, with the caption: ‚ÄúAra Jo. Artist, Pubster. Died December 2, 2016 in the ‚ÄòGhostship‚Äô warehouse fire.‚ÄùAs for actual kin: John and Peggy‚Äôs two sons have other lives and jobs, but the pub is still the family business. John Patrick, 28, works the bar Mondays and Tuesdays, places orders and has begun to shadow his dad on managerial tasks; Ian, 26, makes warehouse trips and keeps the ivy outside from overtaking the place. John Patrick would like to make a few improvements, but he‚Äôs come to appreciate the pub‚Äôs anachronisms. ‚ÄúI think of that broken grandfather clock as a metaphor for the whole place. It‚Äôs stuck in time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd a lot of that has to do with my dad‚Äôs ability to change things at the pace of a snail.‚ÄùAt 11:30, the arrival of a regular out on the patio signals that the elder Schmidt should start the day‚Äôs office work. To be clear, although his kids are helping out, Schmidt doesn‚Äôt plan to hand the place down or otherwise retire anytime soon. Asked if he‚Äôd like to work here for the rest of his life, he shrugs.‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he says, as he goes to greet his customer. ‚ÄúUnless I find something else I really like to do.‚ÄùEmma Silvers is a San Francisco freelance writer.

125.0,Food,"Six hours before Firefly Restaurant in Noe Valley opens for dinner, the house is already bustling: Two cooks prep dinner in a galley kitchen that barely fits three. Chef Haley Sausner sits at a dining room table, flattening roasted sweet potatoes with the back of a spatula and talking to owner Brad Levy at the bar. Levy‚Äôs younger daughter, still on winter break, reads in the dining room while, in the opposite corner, the elder studies for her bat mitzvah. In between errands, Jennifer Tuerk, Brad‚Äôs wife, wanders in, pulled by two small dogs, which Brad warns deliverymen to not look in the eye.This is what a neighborhood bistro looks like in the months after its 25th anniversary: not an end point, by any means, but a destination nonetheless. Even 10 years ago, personal, outwardly modest restaurants like Firefly, which deliver stellar meals at an affordable price point, formed the Bay Area‚Äôs culinary sweet spot. Now the business model doesn‚Äôt make sense given the high cost of labor and rent.New restaurants make the zeitgeist. Classic restaurants like Sam‚Äôs Grill or Chez Panisse are beloved because they never change. Middle-aged bistros like Firefly, Rivoli, Town‚Äôs End, Blue Plate, the House, or Insalata‚Äôs skirt between those two poles. They are doing everything right. And success has made them outliers.Back when he was a 34-year-old chef de cuisine at a downtown restaurant named Embarko, Levy and one of his fellow cooks, Veva Edelson, would mull over what they‚Äôd do if they had their own place. It would be tiny, and they would cook what they wanted, of course ‚Äî they came up with the slogan ‚Äúhomestyle with global influences.‚Äù The menu would change every day.The flagging Spanish restaurant they found on 24th Street wasn‚Äôt minuscule enough for them, but they could buy the business for $27,000, borrowing from family and filling up their credit cards. ‚ÄúWe really knew nothing. So stupid,‚Äù Levy says now. ‚ÄúBut it was a time when you could be stupid and get into the restaurant business.‚ÄùDespite the location, several blocks above Noe Valley‚Äôs family-oriented commercial strip, Firefly became one of the city‚Äôs capital-H hot restaurants when it opened in November 1993. Within a few months, The Chronicle named Brad Levy one of its Rising Star Chefs. His class included Wendy Brucker (Rivoli), Traci Des Jardins (Jardiniere), Michael Mina (Aqua) and Loretta Keller (Bizou), all of whom were forced to pose on ladders holding oversized kitchen tools.And then, hey, well, a quarter-century! The earnest, underachieving San Francisco of the 1990s became a city with more Michelin three-starred restaurants than New York, where journalists stalk young chefs before their places open and then forget them until their restaurants close, and where every meal might earn a cook Yelp stars or sniping over some tangential flub. Levy‚Äôs fellow Rising Star, Traci Des Jardins, opened side projects around the city; Michael Mina opened even more around the country.Firefly stayed the course.How do you write about a neighborhood restaurant that has been open for 25 years, and still serves an enviable 70 to 90 diners on weekdays and well over 100 on weekends? Or an owner who hasn‚Äôt flared out in cocaine-addled breakdowns, though he did pull back from the kitchen a decade ago to raise his kids, which is not as titillating?Stability defies the rules of storytelling. Restaurant workers surf drama every night ‚Äî a thousand disasters, swerved around or blearily survived ‚Äî and yet there is no narrative arc to be found in the color of Firefly‚Äôs walls, which used to be yellow and are now a deep Kermit the Frog green. Or the dining room, which was carpeted and now is not.At the same time, how is it not a story that a restaurant can make it to the age of 25?Levy‚Äôs generation of chefs sees their success with a mix of pride, isolation, doggedness and gratitude. ‚ÄúLongevity is not a big part of this restaurant scene,‚Äù says Levy‚Äôs Rising Star classmate Wendy Brucker, chef-owner of Rivoli in Berkeley, which turns 25 on Feb. 1.Two remodels, an amicable divorce and 796 Yelp reviews after Brucker and partner Roscoe Skipper occupied a ground-floor space on Solano Avenue, the two still spend almost every day at the restaurant, though at 60, Brucker only cooks two shifts a week. Rivoli is still profitable, still busy. Yet it‚Äôs hard to know whether the 30-year-olds who constantly refresh their browsers, hoping for a reservation at Al‚Äôs Place, have ever been there. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the new kid on the block, and so you don‚Äôt over time get new reviews, don‚Äôt get mentioned,‚Äù she says.At the same time, Brucker has realized she has no desire to spy on Al‚Äôs Place, calculating out what the kids might want. She doesn‚Äôt need to. ‚ÄúThe thing that has changed most is confidence that the customers who come here want to eat my food,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhen I was younger, I worried a lot about being hip, what‚Äôs everybody else doing, what are the trends. I totally let that one go.‚ÄùHeidi Krahling, owner of the 23-year-old Insalata‚Äôs, attributes her restaurant‚Äôs longevity to its embeddedness in San Anselmo. ‚ÄúI really cared about my sense of community and making the restaurant an integral part of the community. I can‚Äôt say that lightly. That is what we do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe give and give and give, and they have responded genuinely.‚ÄùRivoli‚Äôs, Firefly‚Äôs, and Insalata‚Äôs dining rooms are still filled, and filled with regulars, who may have different expectations of what a restaurant should be than 25-year-old influencers expecting a scene. That familiarity doesn‚Äôt just link chef and customer, but all the staff as well. Cory Obenour, of the almost 20-year-old Blue Plate in Bernal Heights, rattles off a few stats he‚Äôs proud of: His prep cook has been there 17 years; the saute cook, 18; the busboy, 15. ‚ÄúEvery time I walk in this door I think, I‚Äôm glad I created this workplace and this job,‚Äù Obenour says. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs here.‚ÄùBistros in their Twenties‚ÄúWhere are the other restaurants like mine?‚Äù Firefly‚Äôs Brad Levy asked. ‚ÄúBecause I would patronize them.‚Äù Here are a few neighborhood bistros that opened in the 1990s and have retained their original owners.

Van Ness Ave., San Francisco; 415-551-7181, www.walzwerk.comThe 1990s may have been a great time to open a small restaurant on idealism and credit cards. In the 2010s, it‚Äôs impossible to keep one open without constant oversight. Wages and other labor costs have raced far ahead of diners‚Äô willingness to pay more.‚ÄúMargins are tight,‚Äù Krahling explains. ‚ÄúI just watch everything. Every day. All the time. This is not a business for the weak.‚Äù The unsexy details ‚Äî tweaking the bread and linen orders, trimming waiters‚Äô shifts on slow nights ‚Äî are the undertow of the restaurant‚Äôs income, one that will drown an unwary business before its owner sees the depths of the debts.Sometimes a questionable early decision has proved fortuitous. Opening Insalata‚Äôs after 8 years away from the restaurant business, Krahling wasn‚Äôt sure she could draw a big crowd, so she installed a takeout counter. The restaurant took off, but she never let the counter go; as the Age of Postmates has dawned, she has put renewed energy into the takeout cases, and now they‚Äôre a major income stream.At the 28-year-old Town‚Äôs End in San Francisco, David and Mary Sperber shed their dinner hours at the beginning of the decade and have seen their 300-person Sunday brunch crowds shrink. David, who at 75 still cooks on the line two days a week, attributes it to the fascination with the new and to a city that has pushed out so many of the families who made it. But he signed Town‚Äôs End up with Caviar when it was still testing out its delivery software, and corporate catering and delivery have made up for those losses. ‚ÄúIt balances out, but it‚Äôs really hard to make progress when you‚Äôre just balancing out,‚Äù he says.Brucker echoes Sperber‚Äôs concerns. ‚ÄúWe honestly are making a lot less money than we used to, because we have to give our workers a living wage and are trying to run a very tight machine, paying attention to every penny,‚Äù she says. Rivoli has survived two recessions so far. Brucker worries a third might be the Big One.At the same time, she says, new full-service restaurants may be impossible to open, but a lot of diners still want to go to place where waiters take care of them, where they sit at tablecloth-covered tables and eat a meal that makes them feel as if they‚Äôve escaped the present for a couple of hours.Maybe, when the rest are extinct, Brucker thinks, Rivoli will still be there for them.Since 2000, Firefly has always struggled to make money, despite the constancy of its clientele. ‚ÄúA good month would give us a little cushion, and a bad month would make us wonder if we were even going to be open,‚Äù Levy says.Something shifted at the end of 2017, though. It was probably due to Haley Sausner, a Johnson & Wales culinary school grad who came to the restaurant as a 22-year-old line cook and, five years later, runs the kitchen. Their take on food is sympatico, Levy says. He trusts her. She finally convinced Levy to raise the prices enough to make the restaurant profitable. He was too tied to memories of $4.50 bowls of soup and $11 filets of fish.‚ÄúYoung people keep me understanding that it‚Äôs OK to charge $13 for a bowl of soup,‚Äù Levy says.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not OK,‚Äù Sausner counters. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs necessary.‚ÄùThe two have stopped in at vacant restaurant spaces on 24th Street, considering whether they‚Äôd want to do something fast-casual. Everyone‚Äôs doing fast-casual. They can never muster the enthusiasm, though.And so the chef who assumed, 25 years ago, that he would be running the hot line until he retired wakes up and practices piano, then wanders into the restaurant in the late morning to do the scheduling, shop at the markets, tinker with faulty switches and hope to be home by the time the customers come in."
160.0,Food,"This is A Million Plates, the Chronicle's regular column about immigrant food in the Bay Area, centered around the theory that there are a million different plates of food eaten every day in this region. See prior installments: Gabi Lustosa, Manish Tyagi.The only thing Daniel Situ‚Äôs Lower Pac Heights kitchen has in common with the kitchens of his immigrant family are Cantonese ingredients. All of the family kitchens, whether in the city or on the Peninsula, are stocked with fragrant star anise and meaty Maggi seasoning sauce, dry Shaoxing rice wine and bing tong, a brown rock sugar with a caramelized taste that melts into sauces and braises. But that‚Äôs where the similarities end.As a kid, Situ‚Äôs paternal grandmother would cook entire meals in her tiny Chinatown apartment kitchen using only a hot plate with a pan attachment on the floor. Even though his parents worked in the restaurant industry, their Millbrae kitchen has just two cleavers and some pots and pans. (‚ÄúThe oven is just a glorified drying rack,‚Äù  Situ says.)In  contrast, the 28-year-old Situ, who works by day as an optometrist, has a kitchen filled with a sous vide machine, Vitamix blender,  Le Creuset Dutch oven and a Japanese chef‚Äôs knife.His kitchen is a place where old-school Chinese food memories meet western techniques and technology. It‚Äôs the perfect representation of a second-generation immigrant whose grandmother and parents immigrated from China to San Francisco in the 1970s and 1980s to find a better life for their kids.His food is the same ‚Äî a mix of the simple Cantonese food he learned to make as a kid mingled with a culinary curiosity from growing up in the American melting pot. His comfort food is a braised dish he learned from his father called aomei, which is Cantonese for ‚Äúoxtail.‚Äù‚ÄúDad‚Äôs version was nothing fancy, but it was a luxury to us growing up,‚Äù Situ says. He learned his father‚Äôs recipe, then researched similar ones online and began experimenting. He tried pressure cooking and sous-viding the meat, but in the end, he discovered that he prefers to let it braise on the stove top like his father did, albeit using a Dutch oven instead of a clay pot.Situ‚Äôs grandma was the first to move to San Francisco in the 1970s with his dad‚Äôs younger brother. They came from Kaiping in southern China. She didn‚Äôt speak English, so she mainly did janitorial work. She sponsored Situ‚Äôs parents to come to San Francisco in 1987, where they both worked in restaurant kitchens. His sister was born that year, but was shipped back to China to live with her maternal grandmother because her parents had to work. Two years later, Daniel was born, and his sister joined them in San Francisco.Situ grew up with his parents and older sister in a small, two-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, where they insisted on eating together as a family. They mainly ate ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs food‚Äù ‚Äî very simple Cantonese dishes like whole steamed fish with bok choy or gai lan (Chinese broccoli), and steamed pork patties with salted egg.Situ says his parents ‚Äúhave always stressed the importance of being able to whip yourself a meal, along with being able to do other chores around the house. As kids, his sister cooked dinner because their parents worked. He started to learn  to cook around age 9 just by watching. Once, when the siblings were in middle school, his parents left them to fend for themselves for two weeks while they flew to Portland, Ore., to help his aunt open a Chinese restaurant. ‚ÄúThey expected a lot out of us kids,‚Äù he says, although it also awakened a love of cooking in him.Situ now looks forward to cooking dinner at the end of a long day because it takes his mind off  everything else. As he starts to build his braising liquid, he reveals how he deviates from his father‚Äôs recipe, using more ingredients to make a complex sauce, like chicken stock and oyster sauce. He also adds more accompaniments, like dried Chinese mushrooms, carrot and celery (nontraditional, but he loves the flavor they add). Even the oxtails are cooked differently. His dad likes the meat a little bouncy, while Situ wants it falling-off-the-bone tender.Chinese culture played a huge part in Situ‚Äôs life growing up in San Francisco, where the Chinese population is the  largest ethnic minority group in the city. For nine years, his parents sent him to Chinese school, where he learned to write and read Cantonese after school. He didn‚Äôt enjoy it at the time, but years later, he is grateful to be bilingual and have that connection to his culture.His elementary school was a block away from his grandmother‚Äôs apartment in Chinatown, and she‚Äôd watch him while his parents worked. He‚Äôd walk there after school to find homemade snacks, typically a soup she called macaroni (made with chicken stock, frozen peas and corn, macaroni and a slice of Spam) or stir-fried noodles. He calls her food ‚Äúugly beautiful‚Äù (a term coined by restaurateur David Chang), meaning it looked awful but tasted delicious. He fondly remembers shopping in Chinatown to get the freshest ingredients and then watching her cook. He‚Äôd get splashed by the fish at the fish market, and help her buy a live chicken, which she would later kill, scald and pluck in her apartment before cooking it.His culture still plays an important role. He lives with his girlfriend, who is also Cantonese, and it means a lot that she understands and loves the food he ate growing up. They get most of their Cantonese ingredients from their parents (who often shop in Chinatown) and his favorite Asian store, New May Wah in the Richmond District, which has spices, produce and a butcher/fish market. He loves going to Cantonese restaurants with her, especially New D & A Cafe in the Richmond. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hole in the wall restaurant, the best kind, that serves Hong Kong-style food with great happy-hour specials,‚Äù he says.When the braise is done, he serves me a huge oxtail on top of white jasmine rice, topped with cilantro and extra braising sauce. The meat falls off the bone at first tug, and the sauce is rich and full of umami with a hint of star anise and earthy white pepper. It‚Äôs the kind of food that‚Äôs balm for a cold, wintry Bay Area day.Situ‚Äôs dad isn‚Äôt a fan of his version of aomei, but he‚Äôs proud of his son‚Äôs passion for food. ‚ÄúHe encouraged me after grad school to go to culinary school,‚Äù Situ says. He hopes to one day, when he‚Äôs more financially secure."
153.0,Other,"RN74 is going out in a blaze of glory.As the restaurant approaches its Saturday, Oct. 7, closing date, it‚Äôs stoking the blaze: hosting its bygone staff, replaying its greatest hits. It‚Äôs offering some sweet deals: Bottles from the market list are half price on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and if you‚Äôre willing to drop $250, the staff will open up a bottle listed at $750 or more ‚Äî practically wholesale cost.Sommeliers of RN74 past ‚Äî Rajat Parr, Christie Dufault, Dustin Wilson, Eric Railsback ‚Äî have each returned to pour wines. Former chefs Jason Berthold and Adam Sobel have given encores from the kitchen. For anyone interested in some RN74 nostalgia-waxing, it‚Äôs on offer.After eight years in business, the Burgundy-themed San Francisco restaurant is clearing out of its space at the base of Millennium Tower to make way for the Mina Group‚Äôs newest blockbuster: International Smoke, a barbecue restaurant in partnership with Ayesha Curry.It can feel, to the wine geeks who loved RN74, like an unfair contest, pitting the celebrity against Burgundy. One is a newly minted cover girl, the new host of ‚ÄúThe Great American Baking Show‚Äù and the better half of one of the Bay Area‚Äôs most beloved sports heroes. The other smells, on a good day, like a swamp.It‚Äôs not that simple. Now is RN74‚Äôs time to close. Exhilarating in 2009, RN74 no longer makes sense for 2017. In its bright, brief life the restaurant captured the wave of excitement that was building around Burgundy wine, and then, as prices surged, got wiped out by the wave. In many ways, it was a victim of its own success.But it leaves a hefty legacy, having made more than a few wine careers. Its former-employee roster is to the wine world what ‚ÄúThe Mickey Mouse Club‚Äù is to 1990s pop stars. It paved the way for a new generation of wine-driven restaurants with ultra-humane markups ‚Äî think of Augustine in Los Angeles, or Pearl & Ash and Rebelle in New York.RN74 was a moment: a restaurant of and for a particular place and time. The moment has passed. But the moment was extraordinary.It all began when Raj Parr told Michael Mina that he wanted to open a wine bar. Parr had been working with Mina since 2002, first as a sommelier at Aqua, then as the wine director at Mina‚Äôs eponymous San Francisco restaurant. There, Parr compiled a killer wine list ‚Äî so killer, in fact, that he had to reprint the lengthy menu daily because he was constantly selling out of the last bottle of something.That dilemma sparked an idea in Parr: Why not open a wine bar called the Last Bottle, where rare selections could be rotated on a board, like departures at a train station?‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too good a concept for a tiny bar,‚Äù Mina told Parr.In Parr, Mina says, he saw magic. ‚ÄúI had never in my life met someone who could explain wine like Raj could,‚Äù Mina says. ‚ÄúI knew he was dynamic enough to carry a whole restaurant.‚ÄùThe notion of a sommelier ‚Äúcarrying‚Äù a restaurant was then a relatively novel one. To be sure, San Francisco temples of wine attached to famous names ‚Äî Rubicon, Bacar ‚Äî lived on, if only in memory, while a newer spate of neighborhood spots, like A16, were drawing crowds for their idiosyncratic wine selections. But there hadn‚Äôt been a restaurant that prioritized wine so unabashedly as RN74 would ‚Äî or that matched its ambition to have a wine list worthy of a Michelin three-star restaurant, without aiming to be a Michelin three-star restaurant.This turn freed Parr from the Last Bottle strictures, allowing him to narrow his focus on the wine region nearest to his heart: Burgundy. They would name the restaurant for the main artery that traverses the C√¥te d‚ÄôOr, the Route Nationale 74.The timing didn‚Äôt look favorable. In 2009, the city was reeling from the previous year‚Äôs financial crash. ‚ÄúPeople would call up (the restaurant) saying, ‚ÄòWe are coming in with a group of 10, will you give us half price?‚Äô‚Äù Mina recalls. SoMa, yet to welcome Salesforce Tower and today‚Äôs tech explosion, resembled a ghost town. ‚ÄúYou could not see a person walking here,‚Äù Parr says.It made for a rather depressing backdrop to a Burgundy blockbuster. ‚ÄúLook, it was a time people were saying fine dining was dead,‚Äù Mina puts it. Rather, it had become the era of the neighborhood restaurant ‚Äî the Nopa set. Cloches and white tablecloths seemed tone-deaf, garish.Parr‚Äôs proposal: Abandon the tablecloths. Put the waiters in jeans and Converse sneakers. Break the established wine markup rules ‚Äî instead, charge two times wholesale cost, at most. Offer crazy wine deals: a different $1 bottle every day.‚ÄúThere was not going to be any ‚ÄòAre you getting a middle course?‚Äô‚Äù Parr says.It wasn‚Äôt just the $4.5 million opening budget that helped them to achieve this vision. It was also the addition of venture capitalist ‚Äî and baller wine collector ‚Äî Wilf Jaeger as a partner in the restaurant, whose 30,000-bottle wine cellar padded the RN74 wine list.Parr assembled a sommelier dream team at the outset: Christie Dufault, Eric Railsback, Justin Hall and Bernabe De Luna. According to Mina, all of the restaurant‚Äôs waiters were, at minimum, certified sommeliers.As the opening date approached, Parr amplified the hype on Twitter: ‚ÄúThe RN74 ‚ÄòLast Bottle board‚Äô is up. I will send the opening list on Twitter only. Prices are stupid. Get ready!!!!‚Äù he tweeted on the eve of the opening. Right out of the gate, the list boasted deep verticals of impossible Burgundies, like Henri Jayer‚Äôs Cros Parantoux. The La T√¢che bottles ‚Äî that famous monopole from Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti (DRC) ‚Äî dated back to 1934. Offerings from Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, one of Bordeaux‚Äôs first-growth estates, were as old as 1870.DRC, that coveted producer whose least expensive bottlings fetch over $1,000 on a restaurant wine list, and whose priciest bottles can cost a diner $25,000, was served by the glass ‚Äî maybe not from the Roman√©e-Conti vineyard, but the likes of √âchezeaux or Roman√©e-Saint-Vivant. A glass cost around $90, as Parr recalls, and in the restaurant‚Äôs early days, it was always available.On opening night, April 24, 2009, Parr counted about 50 people waiting outside the restaurant at 5 p.m.‚ÄúIt was electric,‚Äù says Mina Group President Patric Yumul. ‚ÄúIt was intoxicating.‚ÄùParr‚Äôs Twitter feed from that first year, announcing which bottles he‚Äôd opened in the restaurant, reads like a portent of the Instagram bottle-shaming yet to come. 1985 Robert Groffier Bonnes Mares. 1990 Rousseau Chambertin Clos de B√®ze. 1989 Dauvissat Chablis Les Preuses. 1976 Krug Champagne. 1940 Ch√¢teau Latour; 1955 Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild, ‚Äúand my Lakers win,‚Äù Parr tweeted in spring 2009, as the basketball team secured the NBA championship.Twitter followers rushed in to snag last bottles before they disappeared from the ever-rotating train board; $1 price tags graced the likes of 2007 Marcel Lapierre Cuv√©e Lapierre. One night, both 2007 Raveneau Chablis and 2000 Ponsot Chambolle-Musigny Les Charmes were available by the glass (for $20 and $39, respectively).‚ÄúThe excitement stayed pretty vibrant for a good three years,‚Äù Parr says. So vibrant that the Mina Group and Jaeger opened a second RN74 in Seattle, in 2011. (Now that our RN is closing, the Seattle location gets its leftover wine inventory.)Then, changes. By 2012, Burgundy prices had skyrocketed ‚Äî a perfect storm of lavish Chinese investment in the region and a streak of freakishly low-yielding vintages. A new sort of global evangelism for Burgundy, in which Parr undeniably plays a role, didn‚Äôt drive prices down. RN74 was going through old trophy bottles at the rate it always had, but it was getting harder and harder to replace them.‚ÄúWe used to drink grand crus every day,‚Äù Parr says. ‚ÄúNow even I can‚Äôt afford to drink Burgundy.‚ÄùIn 2009, The Chronicle‚Äôs restaurant critic Michael Bauer named it one of his favorite restaurants of the year. In 2011, he downgraded his original three-star review to 2.5. Not just wine, but food prices, too, were creeping up. What‚Äôs more, the thrill was gone.‚ÄúIt seems as if RN74 is losing its unique personality; it feels trendy but a little rote,‚Äù reads Bauer‚Äôs review. ‚ÄúLike a great wine, it‚Äôs missing that indescribable quality that makes me long to return.‚Äù (Bauer upgraded the restaurant to 3.5 stars in 2014 under chef Adam Sobel.)At some point, the $1 bottle became nonviable. To compensate for the diminishing presence of affordable Burgundy, Parr added more bottles from California and from the Rh√¥ne. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want this to become a museum of wine,‚Äù he says. But that fate was beyond his control.Parr moved to Santa Barbara in 2013. Though he remained a partner in the Mina Group until 2014, he stopped working the floor. ‚ÄúI was tired of working in restaurants,‚Äù he says. He went full throttle on his wine brands: Domaine de la C√¥te, Sandhi, Evening Land, RPM.Whether Parr‚Äôs departure caused or merely followed RN74‚Äôs denouement is anyone‚Äôs guess, but it certainly confirmed its demise. ‚ÄúThe restaurant still does well,‚Äù Mina says. No knocks on current wine director David Castleberry and sommeliers Jeremy Shanker and Margaret Spillane; the wine list  maintains a superlative Grand Award from Wine Spectator.‚ÄúBut does it have that same magic it had in those first few years?‚Äù Mina poses. ‚ÄúNo.‚ÄùClosing RN74 wasn‚Äôt in the plans, Mina swears. But as the Ayesha Curry project began to take flight, the swap almost seemed preordained. He looked at 30 locations for International Smoke, and every time, Mina says, he kept thinking that he wanted something just like RN74.‚ÄúFinally I said ‚Äî it just makes sense to put it here.‚ÄùIn every way International Smoke makes more sense. What better restaurant to capture a new audience ‚Äî an audience that populates Salesforce Tower, and an audience that the  Mina Group needs to win ‚Äî than a barbecue concept? It may not have √âchezeaux by the glass, but it will almost certainly have Drake.If RN74‚Äôs denim-clad waitstaff seemed revolutionary in 2009, it would scarcely bear noting in 2017. Today we don‚Äôt blink when a restaurant like Lazy Bear opens, serving $185 tasting menus on bare communal tables.What comes after RN74? For Burgundy lists, for wine restaurants in San Francisco? As Burgundy rarefies, are the region‚Äôs wines becoming less an object of wine geekery, and more a token of conspicuous consumption? Did natural wine succeed it? Newer hot-ticket wine lists are more likely to champion their focus on minimalist winemaking (Ordinaire), on gender equality (Tartine Manufactory), on all-around obscurity (the Morris).There‚Äôs a temptation, as stories like these unfold, to imagine successors and heirs ‚Äî an evolution, not a death. But maybe some restaurants, and the ideas behind them, aren‚Äôt meant to keep their bloodlines alive. What made RN74 so thrilling in its earliest days is gone, I think irreparably. At least, it‚Äôs gone for any restaurant that would stake its identity on Burgundy."
91.0,Food,"From the moment we learned that Japan‚Äôs Sapporo had acquired Anchor Brewing, I could already hear the gasps and groans.The story is so familiar these days that it‚Äôs become cliche: beloved craft brewery, squeezed by today‚Äôs frenetic beer market and unable to expand without extra help, sells to big company. Equally cliche are the all-too-predictable reactions that inevitably follow, bemoaning that the little guys are selling out to greedy corporate interests intent on destroying craft beer. In San Francisco, the emotional stakes are especially high when it comes to Anchor. Not only is it our brewery ‚Äî our first, our signature ‚Äî but it‚Äôs America‚Äôs original craft beer. It‚Äôs an icon of independence, and has seemed, at least we thought, large and established enough to be insulated from the pressures that have forced others to sell.So powerful is the Anchor legend that Lagunitas founder Tony Magee invoked it when he announced in May that he had sold the entirety of his Petaluma brewery to Heineken: ‚ÄúThe revolution in brewing and in beer culture that began at 1705 Mariposa Street in San Francisco has metastasized to every corner of the world,‚Äù he wrote in a blog post justifying his own decision to sell.But let‚Äôs keep in mind that this is hardly the first time Anchor has sold. Anchor‚Äôs very founding, in 1896 by Ernst F. Baruth and Otto Schinkel Jr., was a buyout of sorts: The father and son-in-law bought an existing brewery on Pacific Street and rechristened it with their own brand. Over the next half-century, that brand saw several owners ‚Äî Joe Kraus, Joe Allen, Lawrence Steese, all struggling to keep the dismal business afloat. Anchor was on the verge of closure when Fritz Maytag bought it in 1965. You might say Maytag was a harbinger of corporate America himself, heir to his family‚Äôs washing-machine dynasty.Even if Maytag was the soul of Anchor‚Äôs modern era (and I believe that he was) ‚Äî well, he‚Äôs long gone anyway: He sold the brewery to the Griffin Group, a local investment firm, in 2010. Griffin is no AB InBev, but its partners, Keith Greggor and Tony Foglio, are former executives of Skyy Spirits. And Scott Ungermann, who in 2016 succeeded brewmaster Mark Carpenter (with Anchor since 1971), came to Anchor fresh from a nearly 20-year career with Anheuser-Busch.I mention these things only in the interest of complicating that cliche narrative that tends to pervade the discussions of craft brewery acquisitions. It‚Äôs not as simple as David versus Goliath. Anchor already had plenty of Goliath in it.It‚Äôs hardly worth rehashing the reasons why Greggor and Foglio might want to sell Anchor. As with Lagunitas, increasing global distribution has become a top priority, and that requires Sapporo-level muscle. Anchor‚Äôs beers are in about 20 countries today, Greggor said; Sapporo will grow that. Expansion, after a certain point, becomes impossible without outside investment.Maytag himself put this chain of events in motion. He chose as a successor a business with real financial interests. He could have chosen a different successor if he had hoped that emotional ties, rather than dollar signs, would determine the brewery‚Äôs legacy. To the investment group, Anchor is just that ‚Äî an investment.As for Sapporo, it‚Äôs something of a wild card in this craft-beer-versus-big-beer narrative. It‚Äôs a private company, and we don‚Äôt know exactly how much beer it makes. Like Anchor‚Äôs, its founding dates to the late 19th century. Like Anchor‚Äôs, its identity is closely tied to its city of origin. It‚Äôs never acquired a U.S. beer company before. Its only M&A activity since World War II was its 2006 purchase of Canadian beer giant Sleeman.The public relations line, naturally, is that Sapporo is committed to Anchor‚Äôs values of ‚Äúquality, authenticity and heritage,‚Äù in Greggor‚Äôs words. What that means in practical terms remains to be seen. They say they won‚Äôt expand production beyond the current Potrero Hill brewery, which is currently at only about 55 percent capacity and has plenty of room to grow. Beers won‚Äôt change, staff won‚Äôt get laid off, Greggor said ‚Äî but then again, that‚Äôs the script for these sorts of press releases.Will the critical reactions, too, follow their usual script? No doubt the Bay Area craft beer community will bemoan the loss of Anchor‚Äôs independence. It should. But it‚Äôs hard to imagine Sapporo striking an equivalent chord to AB InBev, or even Heineken. Maybe it‚Äôs more like Duvel acquiring Firestone Walker: a sizable foreign player, sure, but one that appears a little less intent on world domination.Or maybe there‚Äôs no script for where things go now. After the nostalgia, a deeper question remains: What is the future of the midsize American brewery? Big Beer, especially with the merger of AB InBev and SABMiller, keeps getting bigger. And craft beer keeps getting craftier. Especially in the Bay Area, micro-size breweries have found a comfortable business model in high-revenue taprooms, self-distribution and the righteousness of their independent-craft ethos. For the guys in the middle ‚Äî Sierra Nevada, 21st Amendment, Bear Republic, Speakeasy, Anchor, Lagunitas ‚Äî the Goldilocks principle doesn‚Äôt seem to be holding up.Lagunitas couldn‚Äôt do it. Neither could Speakeasy. Now Anchor‚Äôs down, too."

It is often a half-conscious lunch or a fourth-drink chaser. In contrast, Josey Baker's Monday-evening pizza nights at the Mill have a festive air, laptops nowhere in sight. Inspired by the Cheese Board, Baker and his staff only make one type of pizza a week, always vegetarian, posting the day's toppings on his Instagram feed (@joseybakerbread). One recent pie featured mushroom, green garlic and fava green pesto, another smoked gouda, broccoli, lemon and chile flakes. The toppings are just ornaments, really, for a great sourdough crust, savory with freshly ground whole wheat and a last-minute brush of garlic oil.

Il Pollaio (""hen house"") has been making these Argentine-Italian roast chickens since 1984, and they still serve half and whole chickens to a steady stream of old-school neighborhood regulars. Anyone who says that grilled chicken is boring has obviously never had a great version like this, with taut, bronze skin flecked with charred bits and herbs from the marinade, and moist meat with a faint citrus flavor only enhanced with a squeeze of fresh lemon. A half chicken will set you back 10 bucks, but a whole one is only $16, making this one of the better dining deals for couples in the city.

Then turn your attention to the happy-hour food. Obviously you should take advantage of top-shelf $1 oysters, pristine Washington Shigokus on a recent visit, served on ice and ready to be anointed with lemon and vinegary mignonette. Chase them with three juicy pork sausages a little bigger than a breakfast link, which come with sauerkraut and spicy mustard and have all the charcuterie deftness of sister restaurant Trou Normand. And the bar‚Äôs elegantly spare, poured-concrete aesthetic makes it one of the more sophisticated rooms in town for a sausage party. (AR)355 11th St. (at Folsom Street), San Francisco.

Belcampo‚Äôs humanely raised cattle spend their lives grazing on organic Mount Shasta grassland, which gives their meat a wonderfully gamey presence ‚Äî a reminder that this is how beef is meant to taste. On the 3-ounce Fast Burger, a tribute to In-N-Out, the juicy patty needs only a few adornments: a soft bun, melty house-made American cheese, a thick slice of tomato, and layers of iceberg lettuce and red onion. Thin Kennebec fries round out the fast food experience, though you won‚Äôt find the accompanying garlic aioli or aromatic house ketchup at a drive-through anytime soon. And instead of fluorescent lights and bolted stools, the Russian Hill dining room has library paneling, marble-top tables, peacock-blue booths and taxidermied pheasants, all of which makes you feel like you‚Äôre eating in a tony country house instead of the back half of a butcher shop.

Based on the grand Gold Rush tradition of luring in punters with free food, this upscale North Beach saloon offers afternoon drinkers a gratis entree every Friday, based on the whims of chef Michael Miller. One week may bring a comforting bowl of braised gigante beans with Italian sausage and greens, the next curried cauliflower with green lentils and herb-laced Greek yogurt, or chicken thighs with Spanish rice and squash salad. Though classic cocktails are the bar's specialty, two Anchors or Trumers satisfy the drink requirement just fine (and we've always found that two midday cocktails lead to nothing but an afternoon nap). Comstock often posts the dish on social media around noon on Fridays, but come on: Isn‚Äôt it more fun to just show up and be surprised? (AR)155 Columbus Ave. (at Pacific Avenue), San Francisco.

Yet the price is so low that it only seems gracious to tack on an order of plantains with crema or a glass of nutty, sweet Salvadoran horchata made with toasted seeds. Apart from the men who hug their steaming bowls of caldo do res to them as if they're slow dancing with dinner, most of the customers at this warm, familial restaurant are slicing into their allotment of two pupusas, with puckery, oregano-scented curtido (slaw) heaped over the top. La Santaneca de la Mission prepares the normal variety of fillings, but everyone knows the queen of the pupusa is the revuelta, whose corn shell, mottled from the griddle, exudes melted cheese and shredded pork when you slice through it.

Indian Buffet at Viva Goa What: Buffet lunch ($10.99 weekdays, $12.99 weekends)When: 11 a.m.-3 p.m. dailyOh, the glory of the Indian buffet, a choose-your-own-adventure wherein diners can explore and sample at their whim, thanks to the generosity of the restaurant. Set on a stretch of Lombard known more for motels than restaurants, Viva Goa takes the fun to new levels, thanks in large part to its unique regional focus on Goan food, a rarity in the Bay Area. The coastal Indian region of Goa was a Portuguese colony for centuries, and its cuisine centers largely around seafood and spices like cloves, ginger and cinnamon. The lunch buffet includes crowd-pleasers like chicken tikka masala, but the real treats are found in Goan specialties like fish ambot tik, a sour and spicy sauce. It‚Äôs a polished experience, too, with white tablecloths, hot naan on every table, and service that is both exceedingly friendly and efficient.2420 Lombard St. (at Scott Street), San Francisco.

Two walls of windows means that all of the diner‚Äôs red vinyl booths offer broad views of  Sutro Baths, the Marin Headlands and the glorious expanse of  Pacific Ocean, and for a fraction of the cost of the Cliff House down the road. Sure, the two eggs any style served with golden nubs of breakfast potatoes and a toasted English muffin are diner food in the most basic sense of the term. But thanks to a mandate from Louis‚Äô landlord, the National Park Service, the eggs are local and cage-free, the coffee is organic and fair trade, and the whole operation subscribes to the sustainable Bay Area ethos ‚Äî not bad for a breakfast with one of the best views in the world.

So it is at Stable, the funky-cool Mission cafe. The dish here is simple: one piece of whole wheat bread (sliced from a loaf, very old school), lightly toasted, a half avocado neatly sliced and fanned across it, with a perfectly hard-boiled egg halved alongside. Add salt and pepper and you're good until noon; add a well-made, strong cappuccino and you might make it until 3. Once you've ordered at the counter, seat yourself in the Stable's sweet garden ‚Äîperfect in the morning light ‚Äî and a server will bring you your toast on a real plate. Twee is good.

We chose this one because the side dishes and accoutrements of Korean cuisine make it feel like a major meal instead of  a quick bite. First a tall glass of barley tea arrives, followed by banchan: five little bowls of spicy kimchi, steamed broccoli, marinated radish, bean sprouts with sesame oil and fish cake with chili paste. Then it's time for the sizable main course. They do a good tofu soup and decent kalbi, but my go-to is the dot-sot bibimbap, which comes to the table in a sizzling furiously stone bowl. Break the egg, add the sauce and mix with the rice, grated vegetables and marinated beef. Be sure to use the spoon to scrape off the crust that forms at the bottom, a delicacy. Manna isn't anything special on the inside, but it's clean and bright, and its large corner windows let you watch the neighborhood go by as you eat. Bonus: It's only a block from Golden Gate Park for a post-meal ramble. (AR)845 Irving St. (at 10th Avenue), San Francisco.

The mauve walls and ebony-stained tables make it a respectable site for a date, but as the high proportion of students in the room attest, young love can afford it. Xi‚Äôan lies at the gustatory intersection of sour and spicy, which you can taste in the Qishan minced pork noodles. A bundle of chewy, smooth hand-pulled noodles hides under the surface of the broth, obscured by a ruddy cap of chili oil, ground pork, scallions and fried tofu. The broth is warming in every sense, though not painfully so, and torqued with just enough rice vinegar to hold your interest until every noodle is gone.

Carved Meat at Tommy‚Äôs Joynt What: Dinner platter ($11.79), or sandwich ($7.87) + Anchor Steam ($5)When: 11 a.m.-1:40 a.m. (Bar opens at 10 a.m.)For this San Francisco native, making the choice between Red‚Äôs Java House and Tommy‚Äôs Joynt is like choosing between the Giants and Warriors. While there is nothing better than a burger and a Bud outside at Red‚Äôs (fact), there remains few San Francisco food traditions more enjoyable than the hofbrau queue at Tommy‚Äôs Joynt. It‚Äôs there that city generations and demographics are united in a quest for any hand-carved meat your mood desires: roasted turkey, brisket, pastrami, ham and so on. The meat is artfully plopped atop your choice of sides (potato salad, cole slaw, bean salad and the like). You grab your tray, load up a few free pickles and find your seat. You speak to your new neighbors as you dollop hot mustard and horseradish on your too-generous portion of meat. Wash it all down with a beer. Remember how much you love this city. Repeat for the rest of your life, just like many before you. (PL)1101 Geary Blvd. (at Van Ness Avenue), San Francisco. (415) 775-4216. www.tommysjoynt.com Combo #17 at Tu Lan What: #17 with grilled pork kebab, imperial roll and rice noodles ($8.25) and Vietnamese coffee ($2.25)When: 11 a.m.-9:30 p.m. Mon.-Sat.There‚Äôs a lot to recommend at this permacrowded Vietnamese dive near Civic Center, but going to Tu Lan and not getting the imperial rolls is like visiting San Francisco and never seeing the Golden Gate Bridge. They are sublimely greasy, with a spiced minced pork and glass noodle filling that seems to melt into the crisp wrappers that come still puffed up from the fryer. You could make a meal of imperial rolls on their own, but for the sake of afternoon productivity I recommend longtime favorite combo #17, which pairs one roll with marinated grilled pork, rice noodles, peanuts, cilantro and marinated carrots, all tied together with zingy nuac cham. Despite its touted Julia Child endorsement, the 39-year-old Tu Lan is not glamorous. It closed for most of 2013 thanks to health code violations, and the cramped two-story restaurant, imbued with the scent of the grill and fryer, is still pretty shabby. That‚Äôs part of its charm, and I‚Äôve always found a visit a panacea for a bad day, a hangover or just an ordinary Tuesday. (AR)"
145.0,Food,"In the room behind the butcher cases and hanging ducks at Hing Lung Co. on Stockton Street, the temperature rises 15 degrees. One cook uses a scoop big enough to rescue a baby from a bathtub to lift curled pork cracklings out of a wok of duck fat. Another cook pulls birds out of tubs of chilled salt water to trim the feet and excess fat and sew up the cavity, sealing in the juices.Simon Cheung, latex gloves on, rubs spices and salt into the crevices of a butterflied pig carcass. Meanwhile, his brother, Eric, opens the door to a 6-foot-high silver cylinder. Heat pours out. With it comes the smell of toasted pig fat, star anise and browning meat.It takes an hour and a half to roast a pig for siu yok ‚Äî Cantonese crispy-skin roast pork ‚Äî in the vertical oven. Eric stands by the whole time. He applies melted lard to the skin with a paintbrush, pokes the skin to release fat trapped under the skin, controls the flames with a practiced flick of the foot to the right lever.The two brothers, burly and rubber-booted, each look like their own man but they sound almost identical. Their sentences echo and overlap each other. A subwoofer growl rolls out of their big bass voices when they emphasize a point or throw in a ‚Äúdude!‚ÄùEric Cheung, the elder at 42, never planned to become a master duck and pig roaster. His younger brother Simon, 37, had no intention of joining the family business. They emigrated from Hong Kong to San Francisco as kids and grew up in the Sunset. Both watched their dad, Wing Cheung, put in long days at Hing Lung, then buy the business in the 1990s.In his 20s, Eric sold cell phones. Simon attended culinary school after high school until Wing convinced him he could learn all he needed to know at Hing Lung. Wing told Eric that, as the boss, he wouldn‚Äôt have to work hard ‚Äî he could tell his employees what to do.‚ÄúHe tricked us, man!‚Äù Eric says.‚ÄúYeah, tricked us!‚Äù Simon adds simultaneously. ‚ÄúThis is hard work.‚ÄùThe word ‚Äúhard‚Äù rumbles from his chest. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd see my dad, he‚Äôs this old Chinese guy, doing this crazy (stuff), lifting up heavy boxes. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòI got it! Don‚Äôt worry!‚Äô When we see that, we gotta help, you know?‚Äù Wing protested and protested, they say, until he switched up and told them, ‚ÄúAll right, you guys take care of it.‚ÄùSuddenly, they were doing all the heavy lifting. They both cackle at the memory.In the fall of 2014, Hing Lung‚Äôs roaster quit a week before the Moon Festival, one of Hing Lung‚Äôs busiest days. Eric, who had only watched him work, decided to step in.Eric called on the expertise of a few men he calls ‚Äúsifu‚Äù (‚Äùmaster‚Äù or ‚Äúteacher‚Äù), including Wei Zhi Guo, head roaster at Hing Lung while he was growing up, and Tie Q. Zhu, who is still in charge of braised and other cooked meats at the shop.It was slow going at first ‚Äî four hours to roast one pig, instead of finishing one every 90 minutes. The sifus taught him right, Eric says. But he would return home from the shop and study online articles and YouTube videos, trying to make the food even better: Cutting out shortcuts. Testing out new methods of seasoning the meat. Learning how to play the valves of the oven so the pressure inside would make the duck skin puff up and turn glassy in the heat. The quality of Eric‚Äôs roasting improved, then the speed.At the same time, however, many of the Chinatown roast-meat shops embarked on a price war. The younger Cheungs figured their best bet was to focus on quality instead of trying to keep up. They also convinced their father they needed to pay workers city wages and offer dinner breaks and sick time, instead of below-market rates doled out in cash.‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù Simon says of that latter approach. ‚ÄúWe were reared immigrants, too. My dad, as the boss, that‚Äôs what he was doing in order to raise a family of five.‚ÄùThey‚Äôre proud of Hing Lung‚Äôs new labor policies ‚Äî proud enough to write about them on their Yelp profile ‚Äî and yet at times their stance sets them at odds with the neighborhood. It can be hard to find staff willing to accept paychecks with all the normal tax deductions. The shop charges $20 for a roast duck, not the $14 the neighbors do.Simon sometimes spends 10 minutes convincing a customer to buy a half-pound of pork because it costs $8 a pound instead of $4.99. He sometimes works at the counter, the only English-speaker there, where he enjoys drawing in non-Chinese customers and teaching them how to order the best cuts of roast pork.Things might be easier in another neighborhood, they speculate. They dream of expanding to the Sunset or Richmond, where customers won‚Äôt harangue them for their higher prices, shops with shiny, well-lit kitchens that Eric‚Äôs three kids might want to work in. But Stockton Street will always be their base.‚ÄúI love Chinatown, man. I love Chinatown,‚Äù Eric says.‚ÄúWe love Chinatown,‚Äù Simon echoes. ‚ÄúWe grew up here.‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hold on to this (place) forever,‚Äù Eric adds.He opens the oven door and rubs a wire scrubber over the golden skin of the pig, polishing off any burned spots, checking the surface to make sure it is evenly covered in fine ‚Äúsesame-seed‚Äù bubbles.The siu yok comes out of the kitchen at 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., sometimes more often. Regular customers cluster around the counter when a fresh pig arrives, vying for the richest, most flavorful cross section. To get to it, the butcher cuts off the shoulder quadrant, then slams his cleaver through the ribs and crunchy skin to cut the pork into sharp-edged rectangles. The bubbly skin cracks loudly when you eat, yet the aromatic meat underneath is almost as tender as if it had been braised.The sifus stop by the shop sometimes to visit. Simon says Sifu Guo tells Eric, ‚ÄúI taught you something and you built it a totally different way, and (your meat is) better than mine.‚ÄùEric growls, ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt say (anything) because it works.‚ÄùThey cackle again.

104.0,Other,"The first recipe I mastered as a kid was one for brownies, clipped from the pages of Seventeen magazine. I made them over and over again; when my family finally tired of them, I brought batches to my small town‚Äôs public librarians. Those brownies were the first ‚Äî and for a time, the only ‚Äî recipe in my repertoire.Fast-forward three decades, and those brownies have multiplied: This week, I published my first solo cookbook, ‚ÄúRepertoire: All the Recipes You Need‚Äù (Little, Brown and Co.; 235 pages, $32). These are my 75 best recipes, the ones I‚Äôll eat forever without tiring of them, the favorite dishes that form the backbone of my cooking life. It‚Äôs my repertoire writ large, the tasty result of honing foolproof recipes for decades, until I can cook them by heart.Like a magpie collecting shiny bits, I added to my repertoire slowly, making sure each recipe was truly worth it.And when the pressures of motherhood and professional life made creative cooking impossible, I leaned into that repertoire, rediscovering recipes that were durable, delicious and time-tested. The book was born out of that process of rediscovery; if I, a career food writer who has co-authored five chef cookbooks, was still struggling to get dinner on the table, I suspected I wasn‚Äôt alone.The concept of a repertoire is familiar to anyone who‚Äôs taken music lessons or learned a new language. To perform reliably under pressure ‚Äî say, in a concert hall or in conversation with a native speaker ‚Äî you‚Äôve got to identify the pieces and phrases that work, and drill them until they‚Äôre second nature.Repetition is the most effective way to improve, whether you‚Äôre a cook, a musician, a doctor or a kid studying math. Yet we rarely bring the concept of practice to bear in daily life. Working from a repertoire makes repetition, rather than experimentation, the defining way you spend time in the kitchen. The result is not only meals that make you happy and save time: You‚Äôll become more skillful, efficient and confident.In his book ‚ÄúFlow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience,‚Äù psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that people are happiest at work when they reach a state of ‚Äúflow,‚Äù or concentration and complete absorption in the task at hand. That‚Äôs the kind of mental peace and focus that only repetition can give.With a repertoire I more often feel flow in the kitchen ‚Äî which is both the center of my home and my place of work. Do something frequently and with focus and it becomes natural, effortless. Repeat a recipe until you can cook it from heart and you'll be rewarded with a delicious meal, again and again.Recipe: Roasted Carrots With Burrata and Salsa RusticaRecipe: Harissa and Honey Chicken ThighsRecipe: S'Mores Tart"
