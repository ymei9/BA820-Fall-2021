4.0,"Half of the PG&E Corp. board of directors will be replaced in the coming months, the bankrupt San Francisco energy company announced Monday as it provided fresh details about previously announced plans to bring in new leadership.PG&E said no more than five of its 10 current directors will stand for election at the company‚Äôs annual shareholders meeting in May. The boardroom shakeup is part of an effort PG&E revealed last month ‚Äî before it filed for bankruptcy protection ‚Äî to add ‚Äúfresh perspectives‚Äù that will provide additional expertise in ‚Äúsafety, operations and other critical areas.‚ÄùPG&E did not say which of the current board members are leaving, and a spokeswoman had no additional comment beyond the company‚Äôs statement that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.At the conclusion of the shareholders‚Äô meeting, which is scheduled for May 21, PG&E intends to have 11 independent directors, a majority of whom will be new to their roles, according to the company‚Äôs statement.One PG&E board member already left after the company announced its intent to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code largely because of billions of dollars in potential liability it faces from the devastating 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires. The departure of that former board member, Roger Kimmel, came just after the abrupt exit of CEO Geisha Williams, who also resigned from her board seat.In its statement, the PG&E board said it recognizes that the company must ‚Äúre-earn trust and credibility with its customers, regulators, the communities it serves and all of its stakeholders‚Äù and is ‚Äúcontinuing to make changes that reinforce PG&E‚Äôs commitment to safety and improvement.‚Äù‚ÄúWe recognize the importance of adding fresh perspectives to the Board to help address the serious challenges the business faces now and in the future,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúWe have been working diligently to identify respected professionals with relevant experience in safety, operations and other critical areas, and we have identified a number of strong candidates.‚ÄùThe composition of PG&E‚Äôs board had been publicly criticized by lawmakers including state Sen. Bill Dodd, D-Napa, who authored key legislation that will help the company handle 2017 wildfire costs. Dodd called for ‚Äúsystematic change‚Äù in PG&E‚Äôs management and board after recent allegations from state regulatory staff that the company repeatedly falsified certain internal gas-safety records for several years.In a statement Monday, Dodd said he supported PG&E‚Äôs announcement but was critical of the timeline.‚ÄúWhile the change in the board is welcome, it‚Äôs still taken way too long,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd it doesn‚Äôt make sense to wait another day on these changes with another fire season on the horizon. Time will tell if this new leadership instills the badly needed culture of safety at PG&E.‚ÄùThe New York hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management, which has been critical of PG&E‚Äôs decision to seek bankruptcy protection, has also criticized the board composition. BlueMountain, which manages funds that own millions of PG&E shares, called on stockholders to replace the entire board and said it plans to announce its own slate of candidates by Feb. 21."

16.0,"Waymo and Cruise, the leaders in the race to make robot cars a widespread reality, saw their vehicles improve at handling themselves on the road in 2018, according to reports that they submitted to California regulators.The annual reports, released Wednesday by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, require companies testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in the state to declare how often humans needed to take control of the cars, an event called a disengagement. They cover Nov. 30, 2017, through Dec. 1, 2018.The reports come as experts, consumer advocates, the driving public ‚Äî and auto industry insiders ‚Äî question whether robot cars will be truly viable for widespread use within a couple of years, as industry leaders have predicted.A fatal accident caused by a self-driving Uber car in Arizona in March undermined the public‚Äôs confidence in the emerging technology. So did several fatal crashes caused by Tesla cars operating in Autopilot mode, although their drivers were relying on technology that‚Äôs not meant to replace humans. And auto industry leaders ‚Äî even ones at self-driving companies ‚Äî have started walking back their rosy forecasts.Experts and the companies themselves cautioned that disengagement is just one measure of performance, while the regulations are fluid enough that companies use different standards for determining what qualifies as a disengagement.‚ÄúSometimes it can be an error if autonomy does not disengage,‚Äù said Jim McPherson, a Benicia attorney and expert on mobility, in an email. ‚ÄúThink of disengagements like a credit score based on one variable, say, money spent. It does not tell us money made, average balance, credit worthiness, etc. Same with disengagements and safety.‚Äù He thinks the reports should be expanded to require more information and better explanations.Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent Alphabet, racked up a stunning 1.2 million autonomous miles in California in 2018. Its testers intervened 114 times, a rate of once every 11,017 miles. A year earlier, drivers had to take control of Waymo‚Äôs cars every 5,595 miles self-driven.‚ÄúA lower rate of disengagements shows that our cars are getting better at recognizing and handling a wide variety of driving situations, including ‚Äòedge cases‚Äô across the cities we‚Äôve been testing in: those unusual situations that a human driver might see only once (or never) in a lifetime of driving,‚Äù Waymo said in a statement.Cars from General Motors‚Äô Cruise division logged 447,621 miles with 86 disengagements, one every 5,205 miles. Last year humans took control of the wheel every 1,254 miles on average. Cruise noted that its miles per disengagement improved by 321 percent.‚ÄúBy testing our self-driving vehicles in complex driving environments like San Francisco, we continue to maximize our (autonomous vehicles‚Äô) rate of learning,‚Äù Cruise said in a statement.At the other end of the spectrum, Apple‚Äôs secretive robot car project, codenamed Titan, showed people taking control of its cars every 1.1 mile. Uber, which pulled its cars off the roads nationwide in late March after the fatal accident, had humans intervene every 0.35 miles from November 2017 until it ended testing. It said many of the disengagements happened for precautionary purposes.Even Waymo CEO John Krafcik recently conceded that driverless cars won‚Äôt be ubiquitous for decades, and even then won‚Äôt be able to handle all types of weather and other conditions. In other words, robot cars that can rival human drivers in all circumstances may never happen.‚ÄúAutonomy always will have some constraints,‚Äù he said at a tech conference in November. Likewise, a top Toyota executive says that the idea of self-driving cars soon dominating roads is merely hype.‚ÄúThere is no doubt that the industry is going through a ‚Äòtrough of disillusionment,‚Äô‚Äù starting with the Uber fatality, McPherson said.Many prominent companies, including Lyft, Volkswagen, Voyage, Udacity, Tesla, Ford and Nio, did not have to report disengagements because they didn‚Äôt test on public roads, instead using private test tracks or simply not testing in California. Other companies such as Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Bosch and Nvidia tested only a handful of cars.Many companies are now seeking to develop driverless trucks, which could operate without intervention on long highway routes."
18.0,"President Trump‚Äôs declaration of a national emergency on the southern border was neither a good move nor a bad move. It was a Trump move.Trump made two commitments when he ran in 2016. He said: I‚Äôm going to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep criminals and drugs out of the U.S. And: I‚Äôm going to put Hillary Clinton away.He was halfway through his term and realized he had achieved neither of those goals. If you count his bluster that Mexico was going to pay for the wall, he was 0 for 3.As Trump would say, not good. Not good at all.So faced with a wall of opposition from Democrats now in control of the House, he pulled an end run. At least on paper and for the press.Yes, he probably has the power to divert military funds to the border. But there is no rush to do so, because it‚Äôs going to take some time to spend what Congress already gave him.He‚Äôs sure to build at least a couple of miles of concrete wall between now and November 2020, to have something he can point to.As for Hillary, Trump can turn to that commitment once his wall is completed. Which means never.The new Newsom: Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs first State of the State speech generated more national attention than any gubernatorial address I can recall.From the pre-speech leak that he was pulling the National Guard out of President Trump‚Äôs border operation, to the final salute to the heroic nurse who risked his life in the Paradise wildfire to save his patients, it carried the weight and tone of a presidential address.It also appeared to uncork eight years of paybacks to former Gov. Jerry Brown, who so often dissed Newsom when he was lieutenant governor.Newsom made a point of distancing himself from Brown on two key issues, high-speed rail and the delta water tunnels. With mixed results.Newsom‚Äôs confusing message on the future of high-speed rail backfired. His people insisted it didn‚Äôt really say what half the world thought it said: that he was giving up on extending the line out of the Central Valley.Fortunately for Newsom, Trump bailed him out by tweeting a refund demand for the feds‚Äô money.That turned it into just another Trump versus the Resistance battle. What exactly the state will do about its bullet-train boondoggle returned to the back burner.Fire friendly: Original Joe‚Äôs was party central the other night when Chris Gruwell of New Deal Advisers booked the place for a 500-person celebration of Shon Buford‚Äôs elevation to president of the firefighters union.Buford became the first African American to head the union. It‚Äôs been more than 50 years since Earl Gage broke the Fire Department‚Äôs color barrier ‚Äî and that took a court order.It‚Äôs been a long road, but now Black History Month celebrations can include this new black achievement.Heart beat: Judy Guggenhime and Pam Baer moved the Heroes & Hearts fundraiser from a midday lunch at the ballpark to an evening party at Pier 48.Why? More space was needed.Some of the notables attending included pro football Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott, ought-to-be baseball Hall of Famer Barry Bonds, former Police Chief Greg Suhr, former Secretary of State George Shultz and two significant contributors: Kaiser CEO Bernard Tyson and Dignity Health CEO Lloyd Dean.About $4.5 million was raised for San Francisco General Hospital.Breed achieves: The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission‚Äôs annual Black History Month luncheon was moved from the Whitcomb Hotel to the Hilton, and attendance doubled.Mayor London Breed was presented with a lifetime achievement award. As she told commission General Manager Harlan Kelly, being given a lifetime achievement award by someone older than she is raises eyebrows, to say the least.Lean in: My recent move to the Millennium Tower has meant taking apart and reassembling many pieces of furniture.It has been both a satisfying and disturbing task.It‚Äôs satisfying because after an hour of work, you get a chair put back together.Disturbing because inevitably when I‚Äôm done, I still have extra pieces.The good news is, given where I live, everything already tilts."
19.0,"FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) ‚Äî Fear washed over Travis Kauffman as he wrestled with a thrashing mountain lion that attacked him on a Colorado mountain trail, but then his fighting instinct took over as he found its neck with his foot and suffocated the young cat.The 31-year-old trail runner recalled Thursday his encounter with the silent cat that lunged at him from behind, clamped its jaws down on his wrist and clawed at his neck, face and body. Striking the mountain lion on the head with a rock didn't get it to release its grip. Neither did his attempts to stab the animal in the neck with twigs.""There was a point where I was concerned that I wasn't going to make it out,"" Kauffman told reporters. ""I had that wave of fear roll over me and thought I could end up there.""It was the first time Kauffman publicly recounted the Feb. 4 ordeal that left him with 28 stitches and a reputation for toughness and bravery that overshadows his wiry frame.""I will never be able to live up to the reputation,"" said Kauffman, who is 5-foot-10 (1.5 meters) and weighs about 155 pounds (70 kilograms). ""The story is bigger than my puny form.""Kauffman said he was running on a trail in the mountains west of Fort Collins when he heard pine needles rustle behind him. He turned to see the mountain lion about 10 feet (3 meters) away.""One of my worst fears was confirmed,"" he said.The cat lunged, and Kauffman raised his hands and screamed. The animal locked its teeth onto his wrist and they tumbled off the side of the trail.Kauffman grabbed a rock with his free hand and beat the cat on the back of the head. He also tried stabbing it with twigs, but nothing worked.""It really clicked after I hit it in the head with a rock and it still didn't release my wrist that at that point, more drastic measures were necessary,"" he said. ""I was able to kind of shift my weight and get a foot on its neck"" until it succumbed.Bleeding from his face and wrist, he jogged back down the trail, where he met other runners who got him to a hospital.""I was just thankful that he had his eyes and his fingers and all his parts, and it didn't look as bad as I maybe would have thought that it could,"" said Kauffman's girlfriend, Annie Bierbower.Colorado Parks and Wildlife officers retrieved the dead cat. They said their investigation and a necropsy confirmed Kauffman's account.""Travis is a pretty amazing young man,"" said Ty Petersburg, a wildlife manager for the agency.Kauffman became the 22nd person attacked by a mountain lion in Colorado since 1990, Parks and Wildlife said. Three of the attacks were fatal.A necropsy report said the cat that attacked Kauffman was male, 4 or 5 months old and weighed 35 to 40 pounds (16 to 18 kilograms). The cat had limited fat, indicating it was hungry but not starving.It showed no sign of rabies or other diseases, the report said, but many of its organs had been scavenged by other animals before the body was recovered.Adult male mountain lions average about 150 pounds, Parks and Wildlife said.Petersburg said officers set up cameras and traps in the area for several days after the attack. They saw no large mountain lions but captured two young ones in good health. He said both are in a rehabilitation center, and the agency hopes to release them back into the wild.Kauffman, who is an environmental consultant, described himself as an avid runner, cyclist and skier who has a pet cat at home. He said he doesn't plan to retreat from the outdoors.""I will go run those trails again,"" he said, but added, ""I will go with a buddy there.""___Associated Press writer Dan Elliott in Denver contributed to this report.___"
20.0,"SACRAMENTO ‚Äî California is preparing to sue over President Trump‚Äôs declaration of a national emergency along the southern border, on the grounds that diverting money to build a wall would harm the state‚Äôs efforts to fight drug trafficking.Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra said at a news conference Friday that they expect to join several other states in challenging Trump‚Äôs action and that a lawsuit will be filed soon. Newsom dismissed the president‚Äôs emergency declaration as ‚Äúpolitical theater‚Äù to satisfy a campaign promise.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been embarrassed, and his base needs to be fed,‚Äù Newsom said. ‚ÄúDonald Trump, we‚Äôll see you in court.‚ÄùSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden earlier in the day, Trump argued that a surge of immigrants and drugs flowing across the U.S.-Mexico border constituted a national emergency, which would allow him to draw on money to pay for construction of the wall without obtaining congressional approval.His acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said Trump would move roughly $6.6 billion from administration accounts to supplement the $1.375 billion that Congress approved in a government funding deal the president signed Friday.Of the total funds, $2.5 billion will come from the Defense Department‚Äôs counter-drug operations and roughly $3.6 billion will come from military construction. Some $600 million will come from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund ‚Äî a pot of money and assets that the government has seized in criminal investigations.The military construction money consists of funding for ‚Äúlower-priority‚Äù projects, according to White House officials, such as facility repairs and replacements that can wait a year or two. Trump said it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt sound too important to me.‚Äù‚ÄúWe had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military, some of them haven‚Äôt been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this (border wall) is more important,‚Äù Trump said.California officials are still reviewing the exact effects of the emergency declaration, but Newsom said the funding diversions would hurt California more than any other state because of its sheer size.He said Trump had pulled the rug out from under state and local law-enforcement agencies and put at risk antidrug-trafficking operations planned in cooperation with the federal government, ‚Äúfor a vanity project, for a monument to stupidity.‚Äù‚ÄúHe is arguing to make the drug problem in America worse by this action, not better,‚Äù Newsom said.Becerra suggested that California may argue in its lawsuit that Trump is violating the separation of powers by declaring a national emergency to get around Congress‚Äô role in appropriating taxpayer funds. He pointed repeatedly to a comment Trump made in the Rose Garden: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need to do this. But I‚Äôd rather do it much faster.‚ÄùBecerra said, ‚ÄúThis is not 9/11. This is not the Iran hostage crisis of 1979. This is a president showing his disdain for the rule of law and our U.S. Constitution.‚ÄúWhen the president himself says that this is not a real national emergency, that he didn‚Äôt have to do this, he‚Äôs our best witness in why he is acting outside the bounds of the law,‚Äù the attorney general said.Several Democratic state attorneys general, along with the American Civil Liberties Union and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also announced plans to file lawsuits over the emergency declaration.Congressional Democrats were also talking about possible legal action. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a statement calling Trump‚Äôs move ‚Äúa power grab by a disappointed president‚Äù that makes the nation ‚Äúless safe.‚Äù‚ÄúThe president‚Äôs actions clearly violate the Congress‚Äô exclusive power of the purse, which our founders enshrined in the Constitution,‚Äù the Democrats said. ‚ÄúThe Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.‚ÄùLegal challenges over the emergency declaration are expected to eventually come before the Supreme Court, whose conservative majority has generally been deferential to Trump‚Äôs use of his executive authority. Becerra acknowledged that Trump may want a court fight because he believes ‚Äúhe can use that Supreme Court to get his will done.‚ÄùOne area that the White House did spare in its search for wall funding was a San Francisco Bay restoration project and California flood-control efforts. The Chronicle obtained a document in January showing that the White House was looking at nearly $2.5 billion allocated for California projects overseen by the Army Corps of Engineers as a possible source of money.The projects included $177 million for building up levees and converting 3,000 acres of former salt ponds in the South Bay back into marshlands, as well as nearly $1.6 billion for flood control on the American River in the Sacramento area.Disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico were also examined as options.The ideas drew swift condemnation from Democrats, and some Republicans also spoke out against the reallocation of disaster-related funds.In an interview with The Chronicle on Thursday, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, a close ally of Trump, said there were ‚Äúother places‚Äù the president could get money for his wall. McCarthy added that‚Äôs something he was willing to communicate directly to Trump ‚Äúvery often.‚Äù"

25.0,"MUNICH (AP) ‚Äî German Chancellor Angela Merkel robustly defended European powers' decision to stand by the Iran nuclear deal in the face of U.S. criticism as she delivered a spirited backing Saturday of her multilateral approach to global affairs and urged China to join future disarmament efforts.Merkel's comments at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top global defense and foreign policy officials, followed days of tension between Washington and Europe over Iran.In Poland this week, Vice President Mike Pence accused Germany, France and Britain of trying to ""break"" American sanctions on Iran and called on them to follow Washington in pulling out of the nuclear deal ‚Äî a call that he renewed Saturday, speaking shortly after Merkel. The three European powers, along with Russia, China and the U.S., signed the 2015 agreement meant to curb Iran's path toward nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief.Merkel said the split over Iran ""depresses me very much,"" but she downplayed the substance of the differences.""I see the ballistic missile program, I see Iran in Yemen and above all I see Iran in Syria,"" she added.But ""the only question that stands between us on this issue is, do we help our common cause, our common aim of containing the damaging or difficult development of Iran, by withdrawing from the one remaining agreement? Or do we help it more by keeping the small anchor we have in order maybe to exert pressure in other areas?""Merkel also questioned whether it's good for the U.S. to withdraw troops quickly from Syria ""or is that not also strengthening the possibilities for Iran and Russia to exert influence there?""Turning to nuclear disarmament, Merkel said that the U.S. announcement earlier this month that it was pulling out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty was ""inevitable"" because of Russian violations.Moscow followed suit, strongly denying any breaches. The U.S. administration also has worried that the pact was an obstacle to efforts to counter intermediate-range missiles deployed by China, which is not covered by the treaty.Merkel noted that the end of a treaty conceived ""essentially for Europe,"" where such missiles were stationed during the Cold War, leaves Europe trying to secure future disarmament to protect its own interests.She said that ""the answer cannot lie in blind rearmament.""""Disarmament is something that concerns us all, and we would of course be glad if such negotiations were conducted not just between the United States ... and Russia, but also with China,"" she said.Merkel also defended Germany's progress in fulfilling NATO guidelines for countries to move toward spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense, which have been criticized as too slow. And overall, she rejected the idea of go-it-alone foreign policy.""Now that we see great pressure on the classic order we are used to, the question now is: do we fall apart into pieces of a puzzle and think everyone can solve the question best for himself alone?"" she said, adding that it's better to ""put yourself in the other's shoes ... and see whether we can get win-win solutions together.""___"
26.0,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) ‚Äî A chemical maker's North Carolina plant may have broken federal law by failing to notify the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before it started manufacturing and repurposing new industrial compounds, the agency said this week.The Chemours Co. also failed to provide information showing when the company learned the chemical GenX contaminated water wells and properties around its factories near Fayetteville and Parkersburg, West Virginia, the EPA said in a violation notice letter dated Wednesday.Federal law requires the producers of potentially toxic substances that ""may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment"" to notify the EPA before the companies start making new chemicals or use an existing compound for a significantly new use. That would allow the agency to investigate their effects.""The review process exists to make sure that new chemicals are safe and that new uses those chemicals are put to are also safe,"" environmental lawyer Robin Smith said. ""It's a basic requirement that's intended to protect health and safety.""Operators of Chemours' Fayetteville plant failed to give those required notices for several chemicals including HFPO, a chemical used to make the compound GenX. GenX has been found in drinking water wells near the plant and also the municipal utility serving the city of Wilmington, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) down the Cape Fear River.The EPA classifies GenX as an ""emerging contaminant"" needing research. Animal studies show GenX has the potential to affect the kidneys, blood, immune system, liver and developing fetuses following oral exposure, the EPA said in a draft report released last year. ""The data are suggestive of cancer,"" the report said.Chemours also failed to contain GenX within its West Virginia plant despite a 2009 agreement with the federal agency that the company would stop 99 percent of the chemical from getting into the water and air.EPA said it found the violations after inspecting the two plants in 2017. Since then, Chemours has made changes to address some of the issues raised, company spokeswoman Lisa Randall said in an emailed statement. She wouldn't say why Chemours didn't provide EPA with the required notices.Chemours also should provide within 30 days information EPA previously asked for describing when the Fortune 500 company first learned that GenX had contaminated drinking water wells near the two plants, the agency said.Its Chemours investigation may find other violations and fines could follow, EPA said.""It's significant that EPA is now weighing in,"" said Geoff Gisler, a Southern Environmental Law Center attorney. ""EPA ensuring the company is properly documenting and registering the chemicals they're using at the site is an important thing to have happen.""___"
31.0,"PHOENIX (AP) ‚Äî Top Arizona Democrats on Friday accused the Republican House speaker of risking the collapse of a drought plan for the Colorado River by pushing legislation that has angered the Gila River Indian Community, a key player in the negotiations to protect the water supply for 40 million people.But Speaker Rusty Bowers dug in, saying he has no plans to withdraw the measure that Gila River Gov. Stephen Roe Lewis said threatens water rights that the tribe gained through a landmark settlement in 2004 at the culmination of a decadeslong battle.Arizona and California are the last of seven states to finalize plans for ensuring enough water exists for cities, farmers and others or risk the federal government drawing up rules as a drought threatens supplies from the river.""I don't know what the speaker hopes to accomplish with this,"" House Democratic Leader Charlene Fernandez of Yuma said in a statement. ""But if it's federal control of our drought contingency measures and the destruction of our Central Arizona agriculture economy, it looks like he's on the verge of getting it.""Sen. Lisa Otondo, a Yuma Democrat, said Bowers was sabotaging the drought plan and ""deliberately attempting to upend years of hard work that went into it.""Bowers' measure would change the state's ""use it or lose it"" water rights law. He said he introduced it because a group of farmers has been ""financially destroyed"" by lawsuits from the Gila River community. He said it's ""unfortunate and inappropriate"" that the tribe is leveraging its support for the drought plan to defeat his measure.If the tribe wants to back out of the drought deal, Bowers said, ""that is their choice. We hope they will reconsider.""Don Pongrace, an attorney for the tribe, accused Bowers of introducing the bill based on the concerns of a ""very small number of farmers"" who have taken water they do not have the legal right to use.""The truth is that this was done purposefully to attack the community,"" Pongrace said of Bowers' bill.Since December 2017, the tribe has entered into settlement negotiations stemming from the court actions it filed against corporations and individuals, he added.The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has given Arizona and California a March 4 deadline to get agreements from all parties within their states, including the Gila River community, or the agency will start gathering comments from Western governors about what to do next. The agency is under the Interior Department, which has broad but unspecified authority over the lower Colorado River basin.Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico in the upper basin have finished their drought plans, as has Nevada in the lower basin.The Gila River leader spoke out against Bowers' measure when it was introduced and issued another rebuke after a committee hearing was scheduled for next week. As speaker, Bowers wields significant leverage over other lawmakers if he decides to use it to push his measure through the Legislature.""This step may very well prevent us from being in a position to approve the (drought plan) in time to meet the very real deadline established by the Bureau of Reclamation, or in fact ever,"" Lewis, the tribal governor, said in a statement.He said the tribe would not sign on to the drought plan ""unless the bill were withdrawn or the community were to receive some other reliable indication that it will not be moving forward.""Gov. Doug Ducey's office declined to offer that Friday, saying Ducey is focused on action in Washington, D.C., despite the challenge at home.""Our current focus is on working with the other basin states to pass enabling legislation through the United States Congress,"" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said. ""We're committed to seeing (the drought contingency plan) through.""Under the drought plan, the Gila River community would provide water for farmers in central Arizona who otherwise would lose it and would store water in Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border that is instrumental to the drought plan. A group that crafted the plan in Arizona is meeting for the final time next week.The Gila River Indian Community established along the Gila River faced severe water shortages after the river was dammed upstream in the 1920s. But in 2004, following a decadeslong battle, it acquired enough water through one of the largest-ever American Indian water rights settlements to fill nearly 313,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools annually.About half of the community's entitlement flows through Central Arizona Project canals that deliver water to Arizona's major metropolitan areas, making the tribe the largest CAP customer statewide. The tribe has been trying to revive its once-thriving agriculture tradition.___"

The news that Amazon is spurning the Big Apple and searching for a different location will undoubtedly spark an unseemly frenzy among other cities, reminiscent of the search for the last golden ticket in ‚ÄúWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.‚ÄùBut what‚Äôs just astounding to me is how Democrats can (almost in one breath, figuratively speaking) champion a Green New Deal that would use the powers of the state ‚Äî taxes, subsidies, regulatory bullying, etc. ‚Äî to herd whole industries into alignment with their vision of a just and green society, and at the same time denounce these very tactics when actually put into practice.The most prominent architect of the Green New Deal is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Under her proposal, cows might suffer, but humans will thrive thanks to all the wonderful new jobs and free health care her utopian scheme would provide.AOC, as she‚Äôs ubiquitously called, rejects the idea that traditional market economics or fiscal bookkeeping should be any hindrance to her scheme.‚ÄúI think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for 100 percent of government expenditure,‚Äù she recently told NPR‚Äôs Steve Inskeep. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not how government expenditure works. ... Government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments ‚Äî you know, bonds and so on.‚ÄùWhen Inskeep pointed out to her that deficit spending is ‚Äúborrowing money that has to be paid back eventually through taxes,‚Äù AOC reversed herself with an impressive lack of embarrassment, saying that‚Äôs OK because this isn‚Äôt spending, it‚Äôs investing. Borrowing tens of trillions for her ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù will pay for itself, ‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre creating jobs.‚ÄùThe Amazon deal would have created 25,000 jobs with an average annual salary of $150,000, but AOC was against it because the agreement amounted to ‚Äúcreeping overreach of one of the world‚Äôs biggest corporations.‚ÄùMaybe it did. But I have news for AOC and others trying to use the precedent of the original New Deal as an excuse to get the band back together: This is how New Deals work.The original New Deal was a bonanza for big business. In their effort to mobilize the U.S. economy to fight the Depression, the New Dealers favored big businesses and ‚Äúassociations‚Äù ‚Äî cartels, guilds, syndicates, etc. ‚Äî at every turn. The largest corporations individually or in association wrote the ‚Äúcodes‚Äù ‚Äî i.e., regulations ‚Äî of the National Recovery Administration and other agencies for their own benefit. It was all done in the name of efficiency and progress.For instance, the big chain movie houses of the 1930s ‚Äî the Netflixes and Hulus of the time ‚Äî wrote the codes in such a way that independents were nearly run out of business, even though 13,571 of the 18,321 movie theaters in America were independently owned.A review board chaired by renowned lawyer Clarence Darrow investigated the NRA and found that, in ‚Äúvirtually all the codes we have examined, one condition has been persistent ... In Industry after Industry, the larger units ... have for their own advantage written the codes, and then, in effect and for their own advantage, assumed the administration of the code they have framed.‚ÄùThis is what happens whenever any government pursues industrial policy: The biggest stakeholders demand to wet their beaks if they‚Äôre going to go along. The resolution introduced by AOC says it will ‚Äúinvest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st century.‚ÄùAs my American Enterprise Institute colleague (and zealous enemy of corporate welfare) Timothy P. Carney writes in the Washington Examiner, ‚ÄúAll of these dreams become real only if the federal government forks over billions and billions to General Electric, Siemens, monopoly utilities, Tesla, Google, and the other corporate giants who hire the right lobbyists and position themselves to pocket the handouts.‚ÄùThe lesson of such efforts throughout American history and across the world is that when the government hugs big business, big business hugs back, and its embrace leaves the rest of us in the cold.The Amazon deal wasn‚Äôt the opposite of what AOC wants; it was a trial run.¬© 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC"
44.0,"TIRANA, Albania (AP) ‚Äî Thousands of Albanian opposition supporters on Saturday clashed with police in an anti-government rally to protest what they say is a corrupt and inefficient Cabinet, asking for its resignation and early elections.Supporters of center-right Democratic Party-led rally broke police ranks as they tried to enter the building of leftist Socialist Party Prime Minister Edi Rama.They threw flares and other objects and tried to destroy a protective cover at the main door, which was later broken. They did not go inside.Police offered little resistance, staying on the side, although they used tear gas and water cannons, and spoke through loudspeakers calling on the protesters to disperse.Two ambulances cars were seen taking protesters allegedly affected by the tear gas.After letting protesters stay for some minutes at the main door, police again formed a cordon.In an interview with The Associated Press before the rally, Democrats' leader Lulzim Basha said they want the government to resign, a transitional Cabinet and early elections ""in order to restore democracy through a parliament that is elected by the will of people and not the money or the threats of the criminals.""___"
45.0,"WASHINGTON ‚Äî House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, a close ally of President Trump, says the president doesn‚Äôt need to take money from California flood control projects to build his wall ‚Äî suggesting the White House won‚Äôt redirect disaster prevention funds as had been considered.‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs other places the president can grab money,‚Äù McCarthy told The Chronicle Thursday.The Bakersfield Republican said he ‚Äúput a lot of time‚Äù into ensuring that federal dollars were dedicated to flood control projects in Northern California and that they‚Äôre ‚Äúa good use of taxpayer money because you get return on investment.‚ÄùMcCarthy said that‚Äôs something he‚Äôs willing to communicate directly to Trump ‚Äúvery often.‚ÄùMcCarthy rarely breaks publicly with Trump, with whom he has cultivated a close relationship. When Trump threatened last month to cut off wildfire relief to California, McCarthy put out a statement that avoided criticizing the president, saying only that he was committed to ensuring aid was sent to his home state.Similarly on Thursday, McCarthy said Trump is ‚Äúthe one that has been leading the charge‚Äù for California wildfire prevention and water storage, and noted he flew with the president to tour the damage from last year‚Äôs devastating fires in Northern and Southern California. Trump has repeatedly blamed California‚Äôs forest management for wildfires, though experts point to a variety of factors including climate change as the cause of larger and more intense blazes.The Chronicle obtained a document in January showing that the White House was looking at nearly $2.5 billion allocated for California projects being worked on by the Army Corps of Engineers as possible funding sources for the wall Trump wants built along the southern border. The projects included $177 million for building up levees and converting 3,000 acres of former salt ponds in the South Bay back into marshlands, and nearly $1.6 billion for flood control on the American River in the Sacramento area.The White House said at the time that there were no plans for such funding diversions. But the possibility has resurfaced as Congress neared passage of a funding deal that would give Trump far less for his wall than he demanded when he initiated a record-setting, 35-day partial shutdown of the government.Trump has said he‚Äôs looking at ‚Äúadding things‚Äù to the government funding deal and finding other money and authority to build the wall.McCarthy‚Äôs comments downplaying the raiding of money for California come as he is settling into his new role in Washington, leading Republicans in the minority in the House. Although the 2018 midterm elections marked a promotion of sorts for the seven-term Republican to the top leadership spot in his party, they also brought on the loss of the House majority and decimated the California GOP. McCarthy lost seven of his California Republican colleagues as Democrats flipped those seats, defeats he attributed to a combination of Republicans being outspent and outplayed on election laws and to its inadequate messaging.McCarthy said Republicans need to look at improving their pitch on issues such as education and the economy that are important to suburban districts.‚ÄúThe Republican Party has to sit back and say, ‚ÄòWhy did we lose? What needs to be changed? Did we not have the resources to put enough out?‚Äô‚Äù McCarthy said. ‚ÄúI believe the next election will be different.‚ÄùIn his role in the minority, McCarthy is already counting victories in causing trouble for Democrats, including on a typically sleepy procedural maneuver called motions to recommit. Under them, the minority party can offer changes to a bill that‚Äôs about to be passed. They‚Äôre typically for show ‚Äî an opportunity for the minority to come up with either a poison pill or a policy that in isolation looks bad for the majority to vote against.McCarthy, however, has been advancing motions that Democrats find harder to dismiss. This week, after freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota appeared to suggest that Republicans favored Israel because of influence buying by pro-Israel lobbies, McCarthy put forward a motion to recommit that denounced anti-Semitism. The House passed it unanimously.But McCarthy says the aphorism that the minority can be more fun doesn‚Äôt ring true.‚ÄúWell, if I have a choice between the minority and majority, it will easily, 100 percent be the majority,‚Äù McCarthy said. ‚ÄúSo no, I wake up every morning (thinking), ‚ÄòWhat does it take to win the majority?‚Äô‚ÄùHis tenure, along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs, marks the first time that two lawmakers from the same state have served as speaker and minority leader together. Coming to Washington in different generations and roles, the two haven‚Äôt had much of a working relationship and often joust as their parties‚Äô leaders.But McCarthy, who already has close friendships with Democrats he served with in the state Legislature, predicts that he and Pelosi will be able to forge an alliance on some California-specific causes.‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll find times, especially when it‚Äôs California, we‚Äôll unite everybody together,‚Äù McCarthy said. ‚ÄúThe issues that have come up so far haven‚Äôt been as much California because of the shutdown and others. ... There‚Äôs times we‚Äôre going to have real differences ‚Äî but not everything is partisan.‚Äù"
46.0,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ‚Äî Winter weather enveloping California's mountains for a fourth straight day Friday kept skiers from hitting the slopes at the start of the Presidents Day holiday weekend, with snow so deep that plows could not tackle it and cities scrambled to find places to pile it.Several routes to the ski mecca of Lake Tahoe shut down, including about 70 miles (110 kilometers) of Interstate 80 from Colfax, California, to the Nevada state line.I-80 was reopened to passenger vehicles Friday evening.Chains were required for travel in many other parts of the towering Sierra Nevada.""All avid skiers are itching to get out on the mountain, but the roads are pretty treacherous right now,"" said Kevin Cooper, marketing director for Lake Tahoe TV.The storm was expected to dump between 3 and 6 feet (1 to 2 meters) of fresh snow in a region where some ski resorts reported getting 3 feet (1 meter) since Thursday. Officials warned of avalanches in the greater Lake Tahoe Area, where heavy snow and high winds were expected through Sunday.Storms also have swamped much of the state with heavy rain that crumbled roads and flooded a resort north of San Francisco where a kayaker paddled through a meeting room after a nearby river swelled over its banks. The onslaught extended into Arizona and other parts of the U.S. West, with a winter blast also hitting Missouri.In California, the heavy snow forced some skiers to cancel their plans.Aura Campa of Oakland and her partner were hoping to take advantage of their season passes and the fresh powder at Squaw Valley-Alpine Meadows resort, but a near-accident on an icy road last weekend made them reconsider.When a main highway through the Lake Tahoe area was crushed with traffic, she drove her SUV on a side road. Her vehicle didn't have chains, and when it was going uphill, the vehicle went into reverse.""That was really scary for us. It was on a tiny hill with a small amount of ice but that was enough for us to think twice about traveling through a snowstorm again,"" Campa said. ""We're not going to risk it.""Authorities told people to stay home as snow kept piling up.""State Route 267 is so deep that plows can no longer plow. They have ordered up a large blower to try and clear the pass,"" Placer County sheriff's Lt. Andrew Scott said in a tweet  with a video of the snow-covered road.About 140 miles (225 kilometers) southeast of Lake Tahoe, Mammoth Mountain was about to break a more than 30-year record for monthly snowfall, resort spokesman Justin Romano said. Skiers and snowboarders should be able to reach the slopes as long as they have chains or snow tires, he said.The resort has already gotten 163 inches (414 centimeters) of snow this month, just 5 inches shy of its snowfall record for February, set in 1986.The storms heavily damaged ‚Äî and in some places destroyed ‚Äî parts of roads leading to Idyllwild and other mountain communities about 100 miles (161 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, but access was not cut off.Crews were starting repairs on State Routes 74 and 243. A route combining surviving portions of the two mountain highways and a county road kept the communities connected to the world, but authorities urged outsiders to leave the tenuous route to residents.""We're discouraging tourism and snow play up there this weekend,"" California Department of Transportation spokeswoman Terri Kasinga said.Highways also were damaged in the nearby San Bernardino Mountains, where ski resorts around Big Bear Lake have an abundance of snow. Kasinga said those routes would be open to the public.In other parts of California, crews turned to cleanup after a storm Thursday led to at least three deaths.A woman pulled from rising water in a flood-control channel in Corona, southeast of Los Angeles, had a heart attack and died. About 50 miles (80 kilometers) east, a man was found dead after floodwaters swept him away in a rural community. A man's body also was recovered from a fast-flowing creek in Escondido, northeast of San Diego.Winter weather extended into Arizona and the Rocky Mountains.Firefighters rescued a motorist who called 911 to report that runoff swept his car down a wash in Tucson, Arizona. In northern Arizona, a handful of popular recreation areas around the red-rock resort town of Sedona closed because of heavy flooding. More storms were expected to drop snow in northern Arizona this weekend.In parts of Colorado, Montana and Wyoming, road crews worked to clear avalanches that had closed mountain highways and to ease the threat of more slides.___"

50.0,"A dusting of cocoa powder covers everything like a light layer of new snow inside the Guittard chocolate factory. The air is hot from roasting and heavy with an indelible smell that blends toast, baking brownies and hay. Vintage machinery clamors and bangs as it turns cocoa beans into chocolate, winnowing, sorting, grinding, refining.‚ÄúI never get tired of milk chocolate,‚Äù says Gary Guittard, scooping up a small handful of the sticky paste coming out between huge rollers that mash together ground chocolate, milk powder and sugar. These ingredients comprise the base of milk chocolate, which he has sneaked tastes of since his childhood.Wiry and focused at 72, Gary is head of Guittard Chocolate Co., the Burlingame company with roots in Gold Rush-era San Francisco. His great-grandfather Etienne immigrated here from France with chocolate in his luggage. Soon thereafter, he opened a chocolate business in 1868, selling its wares on the waterfront. Changing with the times, it focused on wholesale business for nearly a century before rebranding itself with a high-end chocolate bar line in 1997, releasing the first U.S. single-origin chocolate.As the company reaches a milestone of 150 years, Gary‚Äôs daughter, Amy, 36, and nephew Clark, 46, make up the fifth generation to work there. It‚Äôs a constant push and pull between tradition and reinvention as new bean-to-bar competitors appear on the scene. Though tiny compared to the big players like Hershey‚Äôs ‚Äî which bought out competitor Scharffen Berger ‚Äî Guittard is much bigger than niche companies like Dandelion, yet remains family owned. Under Gary, it has taken a sometimes confrontational role both in trying to preserve heirloom cocoa beans and maintain quality standards in U.S.-made chocolate.‚ÄúThere are some other chocolates that are super citrus-y or super this or super that. There‚Äôs a secondary complexity that doesn‚Äôt always suit what I‚Äôm going for,‚Äù says pastry chef Nicole Plue of the San Francisco Cooking School, who, along with cookbook authors Alice Medrich and David Lebovitz and confectioner Michael Recchiuti, are among the company‚Äôs prominent buyers and fans. ‚ÄúI have always loved Guittard chocolates because they taste so much like chocolate.‚ÄùFor the anniversary, Guittard released a baking chocolate called Eureka Works that uses cocoa beans from the same regions that Etienne could have been able to buy from ‚Äî Brazil, Ecuador, Indonesia and the Hawaiian Islands ‚Äî  in the late 1800s, before the Panama Canal was built. Essentially, Gary is trying to hold on to a flavor that‚Äôs 150 years old.It is an embodiment of one of his favorite sayings: ‚ÄúTaste has memory.‚ÄùEtienne Guittard arrived in San Francisco in 1860 and, like so many with gold fever, soon realized that selling supplies would be a better way to make money. The chocolate he had brought from his uncle‚Äôs factory was popular with San Franciscans, so he returned to France to get chocolate-making equipment before opening his company on Sansome Street.The multifloor factory at first also sold coffee, tea and spices. When shipments came in, they were sold right on the waterfront, farmers‚Äô market-style. The factory was located near the original plants for MJB, Folgers and Hills Brothers, with Ghirardelli around the corner. They all thrived by being at a shipping port in a cool climate ideal for manufacturing. Of those five heritage companies, Guittard is the only one that‚Äôs still family owned.When the 1906 earthquake and fire destroyed the factory, the operation moved briefly to Commercial Street and then  to Main Street until 1955. At that point, the city forced the company out through eminent domain to build the Embarcadero Freeway, and it relocated to Burlingame.Gary took over in 1989, when his father and older brother Jay unexpectedly died within six months of each other.He had studied chocolate-making since age 10, and had always wanted to try to make Guittard milk chocolate taste more like European brands he loved.One of his first moves was to improve the company‚Äôs chocolate chips, adding more cocoa butter for refinement. Then, as now, the majority of production went to couverture ‚Äî a high-quality chocolate used for coating confections ‚Äî for candy companies like See‚Äôs. Things changed in 1996, when John Scharffenberger co-founded Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker in Berkeley and introduced intense dark chocolates to the domestic market.‚ÄúWhen John‚Äôs product came out I went ‚ÄòWow,‚Äô‚Äù says Gary. ‚ÄúI felt like this was a niche that we needed to be in to survive.‚ÄùHe had never focused on dark chocolate before, so he consulted his great-grandfather‚Äôs notebooks and called his new line of single-origin chocolate bars Collection Etienne.Native to the Americas, chocolate was transplanted to places like Java and the Ivory Coast after becoming popular in Europe, and each type developed its own characteristics. But around the same time that Guittard began making chocolates that celebrated those unique flavors, heirloom cocoa plants were beginning to disappear, partly due to deforestation and disease. In addition, big buyers were pressuring growers to plant cocoa varieties that produced high yields to maintain dime-store prices for their candy bars.‚ÄúBut nobody ever looked at flavor,‚Äù says Gary. ‚ÄúFarmers never got to taste their chocolate.‚ÄùIn 2012, the company helped found the Heirloom Cacao Preservation Fund, a nonprofit group of industry members that identifies older cocoa varieties around the world and funds projects to save them. Guittard has also set up labs in Ghana and Java where farmers can test beans for quality and taste the final product.In May, the company opened a new factory on property in Fairfield that Gary had bought 20 years ago, predicting land prices would get too expensive when they were ready to expand. For now, they still roast and process the chocolate in Burlingame and bring it in liquid form to the new facility, where it‚Äôs turned into wafers and chips. Chocolate making will eventually happen there, too, when the family will be called upon to transport that 150-year-old taste memory to yet a new location.Eureka Works chocolate will be sold at Williams-Sonoma online on Nov. 15 and in stores Nov. 23 for $29.95 per 500g bar.1848Gold Rush begins1852Domingo Ghirardelli opens D. Ghirardelli & Co. on the corner of Washington and Kearny streets.1860Etienne Guittard arrives in San Francisco, realizes selling supplies is a better bet than looking for gold and returns to France to get chocolate-making equipment.1868E. Guittard Co. opens at 405 Sansome, selling chocolate, coffee, tea and spices.1906The original factory is destroyed in the earthquake and fire. Under Etienne‚Äôs son, Horace C. Guittard, the company moves briefly to Commercial Street, then to Main Street; its main focus is now chocolate.1955The factory is forced out of the waterfront through eminent domain to make way for the Embarcadero Freeway. Now under Horace A., Etienne‚Äôs grandson, the Guittard factory moves to its current location in Burlingame.1978Debut of semisweet chocolate chips.1989Horace A. and his eldest son, Jay, die within six months of each other, leaving Gary, 43, in charge of the company.1996John Scharffenberger and Robert Steinberg found Scharffen Berger chocolate in Berkeley; at the time, there were just 11 other bean-to-bar chocolate makers in the United States.1997Spurred by the success of Scharffen Berger with dark chocolate, Gary releases the first single-origin chocolate in the U.S.2007Guittard fights big candy companies‚Äô lobbying to allow vegetable oil of any amount, rather than cocoa butter, to be used in products labeled chocolate.Source: Guittard Chocolate Co.

56.0,"Marinated Beets With Winter Citrus, Fried Onion Mousse & Crispy Wild Rice Serves 4 This dish from Del Popolo chef de cuisine Jeffrey Hayden is a highly composed riff on a rustic citrus and shaved red onion salad. While fried onion mousse may sound fancy, Hayden assures that it‚Äôs really pretty easy as far as technique goes. Frying the flour coating, says Hayden, essentially creates ‚Äúa crispy roux‚Äù that, along with the cream, thickens the mousse. Most of the components can be made 1 to 3 days ahead and then assembled prior to serving. You‚Äôll need a deep-fry thermometer and piping bag (or zip-top bag). Marinated beets 2 large or 4 medium golden beets, stems removed2 large or 4 medium red beets, stems removedExtra virgin olive oil, as needed¬º cup Champagne vinegar¬º cup red wine vinegarSea salt as neededFried onion mousse 4 to 6 cups (or more depending on size of pan) rice bran oil for deep frying1 medium yellow onion, peeled and sliced into ¬Ω-inch rings2 cups buttermilk2 cups all-purpose flour1¬Ω cups heavy cream Puffed rice 1 to 2 cups rice bran oil, for frying1/3 cup wild riceFleur de sel, to finish To finish 2 blood oranges, peel and pith removed, cut into ¬Ω-inch wheels2 Cara Cara oranges, peel and pith removed, cut into ¬Ω-inch wheels2 navel oranges, peel and pith removed, cut into ¬Ω-inch wheelsFresh herbs, such as chervil, tarragon and basil to finishSumac, to finish For the marinated beets: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.Rub the beets with olive oil. Place the golden beets in a medium oven-proof baking dish, and add just enough water to cover the bottom of the dish by about 1 inch. Repeat in a second oven-proof baking dish with the red beets. Tightly cover both with aluminum foil and roast until tender, about 60 minutes.Let the beets cool slightly, then remove the skins while they‚Äôre still warm. Cut into wedges. Place the golden beets in a medium bowl and toss with the Champagne vinegar. Place the red beets in another medium bowl and toss with the red wine vinegar. Let sit for 10 minutes, then drain separately. Return the beets to their original bowls and toss each with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt. You can roast the beets a day ahead. Keep the skins on until you‚Äôre ready to cut them into wedges and marinate them. While Hayden uses red and golden beets to provide a contrast of colors for this dish, feel free to use any type of beet you like. The chef keeps different colored beets separate while cooking to prevent the colors from bleeding onto each other. He also likes to toss the beets in a similarly hued vinegar  to keep the colors from getting muddy. For the fried onion mousse: Heat the rice bran oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.Separate the onion rings, then soak in the buttermilk for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the flour and 1 tablespoon  sea salt. Working in batches, lightly dredge the onion rings, shaking off the excess flour. Fry in the oil ‚Äî making sure not to overcrowd the pot ‚Äî until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip halfway through cooking. Drain and place on the baking sheet. Season with a pinch or two of sea salt. Let cool slightly.Pour 1 cup cream into a blender and add  half of the onion rings. Start on low then slowly increase to high speed and puree. If needed, use a small ladle or plunger to assist in tamping down the mixture. Add the rest of the onion rings, along with  the remaining ¬Ω cup  cream. If the mixture is too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach the consistency of loose hummus. Taste and adjust seasoning with more sea salt, if desired. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag or zip-top bag and  chill completely, about 30 minutes. ‚ÄúEverybody has some memory of eating fried onions ‚Äî at like the boardwalk or a fair ‚Äî and this texturally and visually completely different element on the plate sort of gives you those same food memories,‚Äù says Hayden. The mousse can be made 2 to 3 days ahead. For the puffed rice: Meanwhile, place two  high-sided saute pans next to each other on the stove. Place a fine mesh strainer in one pan. In the other pan, pour enough rice bran oil to fill by 2 inches, and heat to  475 to 480 degrees (just below its smoke point of 490 degrees).  When you toss in a grain of  wild rice, it should puff immediately. Pour the wild rice into the oil and immediately turn off the heat. As soon as the rice puffs, about 5 to 10 seconds, carefully strain the wild rice by pouring the hot oil into the strainer in other pan.  Drain well, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Season with sea salt.Frying the wild rice in extremely hot oil will burst the outer shell and puff the interior, resulting in puffed, crispy rice that adds a pleasant, crunchy texture to the dish. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like wild Rice Krispies,‚Äù says Hayden. The fried wild rice can be made a day ahead. Completely cool the rice, then wrap in a paper towel and store in an airtight container until ready to use. To assemble:  Pipe two generous dollops of the mousse slightly off-center on each of four large round plates. Use a spoon to make a little well in the middle of each dollop. Sprinkle a little fleur de sel on top of each dollop.Arrange the beets next to the dollops of mousse and follow the natural curve of the plates, but leave some negative space to one side of each plate. (It should look like a large ‚ÄúC‚Äù on the plate.) Next, intersperse the citrus wheels. Season the beets and citrus with more fleur de sel.Sprinkle the wild rice into distinct zones on the plate next to the citrus and beets. Tuck the fresh herbs in between the citrus and beets, tearing the leaves of the larger herbs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid to herb the plate up,‚Äù says Hayden. You should get a little herb in every bite and some crunchy wild rice now and again."

59.0,"I spent a few days in Seattle earlier this month, and on a sunny Saturday I found myself doing what the tourists do, ogling flying salmon at Pike Place Market.It‚Äôs a gimmick, I know, but when I got home I found I was craving salmon, so I guess it‚Äôs fair to say that the gimmick worked.Wild king salmon is back in the markets again, good news for anyone who likes its rich, meaty flesh and a good dose of Omega 3s. Its delicious flavor comes with a high price tag, though, so I like to use it almost as a condiment, topping a generous dinner salad, one that‚Äôs ideal served with a bottle of chilled ros√©.As much as I love salmon, I don‚Äôt love a house that smells like salmon for days after I‚Äôve made it. For that reason I no longer pan-sear the fish; instead I‚Äôll gently poach the filets in court bouillon or employ my favorite method: coating the fish with a paste of herbs and olive oil, then slow-roasting it in a very low oven until it‚Äôs cooked through but still custard-y.I let it cool, then break it into generous chunks. Prepared this way, it can stand in for tuna in a Ni√ßoise-style salad; can be rolled into corn tortillas and topped with a smoky salsa; can be jammed into a soft roll with cilantro, pickled carrots, mayo and fried shallots for an ersatz banh mi sandwich. The salmon is the prize here; this salad is just another way to show it off.

Slow-Roasted Salmon Salad

Her new cookbook is ‚ÄúRepertoire: All the Recipes You Need.‚Äù Twitter: @jbattilana Email: food@sfchronicle.comSlow-Roasted Salmon SaladYou can prepare every element of this salad ahead, but don‚Äôt dress and serve it until right before you plan to eat.Serves 4
Salad
Salad12 ounces salmon (preferably wild king), in one pieceKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper2 tablespoons finely chopped chives2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley¬Ω teaspoon lemon zest1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil4 large eggs8 marble potatoes¬º pound sugar snap peas¬º pound green beans, trimmed1 small head Bibb lettuce1/8 cup finely chopped cornichon pickles
Dressing
Dressing2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot1 tablespoon Dijon mustard¬º cup apple cider or white wine vinegar¬Ω cup extra-virgin olive oilFlaky salt, such as Maldon, for garnishTo make the salad: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Fill a baking dish (a 13-by-9-inch works well) halfway with water and place on the bottom rack of the oven.Season the salmon generously with salt and pepper on both the skin and flesh side. In a small bowl combine the chives, parsley, lemon zest and olive oil and mix to combine. Smear this paste all over the fish to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the oven on a rack above the baking dish. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, until the salmon is flaky but still very moist; use the tip of a paring knife to peek at the interior; it should flake easily. Remove from the oven and let cool, then break the salmon into large chunks and discard the skin and pinbones (they‚Äôll be very easy to remove once the fish is cooked, which is why I don‚Äôt bother to do it beforehand).While the fish is cooking, prepare the salad. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. When the water is boiling, add the potatoes and cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and set aside. Do not discard the water. When cool enough to handle, cut each potato in half.Fill a large bowl with water and ice. Add the snap peas and green beans to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to the ice-water bath. Let stand until cool, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cut each green bean in half lengthwise.Add the eggs to the boiling water and boil for 7 minutes. Drain and transfer to the ice-water bath, adding more ice if necessary. Once cool, peel the eggs and set aside.To make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the shallot, mustard, vinegar and about ¬Ω teaspoon of salt. Let stand 10 minutes, then whisk in the olive oil until combined; season to taste with additional salt."
60.0,"Earlier this summer, I had a change of heart.I was back East, suffering through the kind of heat wave that never hits San Francisco, and suddenly I had a craving for a tart lemon bar, eaten ice-cold straight from the fridge. A lemon bar, I thought, but creamier.And then I realized: I was craving cheesecake. This might seem normal enough, except had you asked me a month ago I would‚Äôve told you how much I disliked cheesecake, those hulking wedges of chalky, underwhelming dessert.But sometimes you just have to indulge a craving (not to mention delight your spouse; my wife has been wanting me to make cheesecake for, oh, 20 years). A couple of days later I pressed buttery graham crackers into a 9-by-13-inch pan; you see, instead of a classic round, thick cake I wanted silky cheesecake bars.In the food processor I whizzed cream cheese, sugar and eggs, along with creme fraiche, which adds a welcome tanginess and prevents the dreaded crumbly texture that plagues the kind of cheesecake I can‚Äôt stand. (Note: sour cream or Greek yogurt would work, too.) I added lime zest and juice, then poured the custard over the par-baked crust.The gloopy, fluorescent canned cherry filling that gets spooned over a classic New York-style cheesecake is never good, and it doesn‚Äôt make any sense when we‚Äôve reached peak fruit season. Instead, I briefly cooked blueberries and spread the compote over the warm bars. I let them chill overnight, then cut the pan into fat bars. The next day I took a bite, and regretted all those wasted years.Jessica Battilana is a San Francisco freelance writer.

61.0,"Brutti ma buoni ‚Äî ugly but good ‚Äî is a favorite Italian expression, and a pretty fair summation of my life as of late. But in spite of how messy my days look and feel, the season of beauty has arrived. It‚Äôs time for decking the halls, for cookies dressed in sparkling sugar, for beef Wellingtons crowned with golden caps of puff pastry. And in contrarian fashion I‚Äôve concluded it‚Äôs time to tell you about one of the very ugliest recipes in my repertoire.Because, you see, when you layer together caramelized onions, toasted squares of rye bread, ribbons of green cabbage and filaments of Gruy√®re cheese, then drown it all in good chicken stock and bake it for a very long time, what emerges from the oven will win no beauty contest. But in a battle for hearts and minds, this cabbage panade will come out on top.Judy Rodgers wrote an authoritative treatise ‚Äî or perhaps it was a love letter ‚Äî to panade in her seminal ‚ÄúZuni Caf√© Cookbook‚Äù (my go-to holiday gift even after all these years). A champion of the glories of peasant food, she knew the alchemy that occurs when good bread meets good stock and good cheese; a supersonic savory bread pudding, one that economically feeds a gathering while warding off winter chill.If you are anything like me at all, you‚Äôre going to find yourself wanting to rush this slow recipe along. You‚Äôll be tempted to turn the heat up under the caramelizing onions, trying to fast-track your way to results that are only earned by patiently cooking them for 45 minutes, until they are slumped in the pot and deeply golden. Please don‚Äôt do this. Once the panade is in the oven, give it a full 90 minutes of cooking time, during which time the bread will lap up the stock, plumping and puffing, and the cabbage will further soften and sweeten. At that point you‚Äôll uncover your dish, sprinkle a cap of cheese on top, crank the oven a bit, and give the panade another 20 minutes, during which time the cheese will melt and the top will get lots of crusty bits. You want the crusty bits. They are worth waiting for.Spoon generous servings into bowls. Avoid the urge to gussy up the portions with chopped parsley. Let it be ugly, in all its glory.Jessica Battilana is a San Francisco freelance writer and the author of ‚ÄúRepertoire: All the Recipes You Need.‚Äù Twitter: @jbattilana Email: food@sfchronicle.com.Recipe: Green Cabbage Panade6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil1¬Ω pounds onions, peeled and thinly slicedKosher salt1 teaspoon caraway seeds1¬Ω pounds green cabbage, cored and cut into 1-inch ribbons1 loaf day-old rye bread, cut into 2-inch cubes (about 8 cups cubed bread), lightly toasted2¬Ω cups Gruy√®re or Comt√© cheese, grated on the large holes of a box grater6 cloves garlic, slivered4¬Ω to 5 cups chicken stockInstructions: In a 4-quart Dutch oven or a large saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and a few generous pinches of salt and stir so the onions are coated in oil. Cover the pot and cook for 3 minutes, just until the onions begin to sweat and steam. Uncover the pot, reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions and very soft and golden brown, about 40 minutes. Don‚Äôt cheat! When the onions are done, transfer them to a bowl. If you‚Äôve used a Dutch oven, no need to wash it; you‚Äôll build and bake the panade right in the pot.While the onion cooks, prepare the cabbage. Heat the remaining oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the caraway seeds and toast them, stirring, for 1 minute, then add the cabbage and ¬º cup of water. Cover the pot and let cook for about 4 minutes, then uncover and give the cabbage a stir; it should be browned in spots and slightly softened. Add a few more tablespoons of water if the pan looks dry, then recover and cook for 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Set aside ¬Ω cup of the grated cheese. In the same Dutch oven you used for the onions (or in a 3 quart oven-proof casserole dish), smear some of the caramelized onions on the bottom of the pot. Top with a layer of bread, a layer of cabbage, some of the grated cheese and some of the slivered garlic. Sprinkle each layer with salt. Continue the layering until you‚Äôve used all the onions, bread, cabbage, cheese (except for the ¬Ω cup you set aside) and the garlic. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer, then pour around the edge of the Dutch oven; add enough stock so that it almost covers the bread, but not so much that the bread is completely swamped and submerged."
63.0,"Discussing the meals one has enjoyed at a favorite restaurant is practically a sport here in the Bay Area.Shift the conversation to a beloved restaurant that‚Äôs no longer around, and the reminiscing can approach Olympic levels of dreamy nostalgia. It seems the only thing the Bay Area loves more than restaurants is bygone restaurants.I don‚Äôt consider myself an overly sentimental person, but I, too, can get misty thinking back on certain restaurants ‚Äî not surprising given my choice of career.Almost 15 years ago, I moved to San Francisco to go to culinary school and immerse myself in the Bay Area‚Äôs food culture. One of my favorite parts of my education was dining out at San Francisco restaurants.Some of the restaurants I visited during my first few years here have faded from memory, but there is one that continues to shine bright: Coco500. It was elegant but not pretentious, and chef-owner Loretta Keller‚Äôs take on seasonal California cooking was eye-opening to a young culinary student like myself.While I couldn‚Äôt afford to eat there regularly, over the years Coco500 continued to hold a special place in my heart, so when Keller announced in 2014 that she would be closing the South of Market restaurant, my husband and I returned for one last dinner. Our order for the evening was a parade of greatest hits: truffled mushroom flatbread, the mole-spiked shredded beef tacos, and my favorite dish, the batter-fried green beans.Sure, I am bummed that the restaurant is gone, but I take some consolation in the knowledge that I can  make those green beans on my own.That‚Äôs the beauty of food and memory: My version might not be exactly like Keller‚Äôs, but one bite of those green beans with their lacy, tempura-like batter, and I‚Äôm transported back to that first meal, and for a brief moment, Coco500 lives again.Inspired by this trip down memory lane, we have compiled a collection of some of the most memorable recipes from the Bay Area‚Äôs most beloved restaurants that have closed, from more recent trailblazers like Citizen Cake and Range to long-gone seminal restaurants such as Stars and Johnny Kan‚Äôs.These recipes serve as a delicious reminder of just how special ‚Äî albeit fleeting ‚Äî our Bay Area restaurant scene can be, and that we should savor it.

65.0,"When you grab a bag of Barkthins, a product billed as ‚Äúsnacking chocolate‚Äù that is made of slivers of pretzels or nuts in a light coating of dark chocolate, you won‚Äôt see anything about health on the label. The U.S. government won‚Äôt allow it, but the nutrition claim is no longer necessary. Among consumers, dark chocolate might forever have a halo of good health.‚ÄúThe idea that dark chocolate is a health food is pervasive in society. Everybody believes that,‚Äù says food policy expert Marion Nestle (no relation to the company), professor emeritus at New York University and former Chronicle columnist.Chocolate is only one example. At the checkout line, magazine headlines scream that chia seeds will detox your body and white beans will ease joint pain, even though few such claims are backed by real science. Nestle has long raised the alarm about how nutrition claims in advertising, news articles and labels ‚Äî at least when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows it ‚Äî are often based on industry-funded studies. Her latest book, ‚ÄúUnsavory Truth,‚Äù is devoted to the subject, and new examples crop up so often that she devotes a weekly post to them in her Food Politics blog.‚ÄúThere must be something about the way that humans are hardwired,‚Äù says Nestle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this degree of magical thinking that feeds into the way human psychology works, and the food companies that do that kind of research know this very well.‚ÄùThe example of chocolate goes back decades. In the 1980s, candy companies like Mars began sponsoring research they said demonstrated a connection between chocolate and heart health, and started putting the claim on certain products before the government cracked down on it, saying the claims were unproven. Even though the  idea was faulty ‚Äî for one, the healthful components in raw chocolate tend to be destroyed in the roasting process ‚Äî we all bought it. Who doesn‚Äôt want to feel righteous about eating candy?One of Nestle‚Äôs recent favorites is a study that claimed to show how drinking beer can help prevent Alzheimer‚Äôs. Another one looked at how regularly chewing sugar-free gum could improve memory.‚ÄúI think the stuff is hilarious. You can‚Äôt make it up,‚Äù she says.The obvious problem with nutrition studies funded by a specific industry group or company is that they undermine the scientific process because they set out to prove the nutritional benefits of a particular food for marketing reasons.But Nestle is also critical of the way such studies promote a message contrary to most nutrition advice: that certain foods are mega-healthy while others are not. Ads that promote blueberries or almonds may be accurate when they describe the fruit or nut‚Äôs health-promoting qualities, but distract from the reality that other foods contain similar amounts of antioxidants or vitamins.‚ÄúThe basis of healthy diets is eating a wide variety of healthy foods of all types,‚Äù Nestle said at a recent event at UC San Francisco. ‚ÄúAll fruits and vegetables have benefits. I don‚Äôt believe in superfoods.‚ÄùHere are some of the well-publicized health claims that food companies have used to promote their products after sponsoring the original scientific studies on which the claims are based.CLAIM: Dark chocolate is heart healthyINDUSTRY BACKERS:Hershey, Nestle, MarsREALITY: Flavanols in raw cacao  have the potential to improve heart health, but they are diminished during chocolate processing. Even if they weren‚Äôt, you would need to eat a whole lot of chocolate (and sugar) to get the flavanols required for better heart health.CLAIMS: Beer combats Alzheimer‚Äôs and can increase bone densityINDUSTRY BACKERS: Several of the Alzheimer‚Äôs study authors are employed by Kirin, the Japanese brewing company. Bone density study was done by UC Davis ‚ÄúAnheuser-Busch Endowed Professor of Malting and Brewing Sciences‚Äù Charles Bamforth.REALITY: The Alzheimer‚Äôs study showed that matured hop bitter acids found in beer could improve memory in mice. The second study looked at how some types of beer can provide silicon, which is linked both to healthy bone growth and can reduce how much aluminum the body absorbs (a factor in Alzheimer‚Äôs). However, silicon can be found in many other foods including milk, meat and cereals.CLAIM: Exercise fights obesity better than dietINDUSTRY BACKER: Beverage industry, including Coca-Cola‚Äôs funding of the Global Energy Balance NetworkREALITY: Much of the medical world blames added sugar in the American diet, especially sugar-sweetened beverages, for a large portion of the country‚Äôs problem with obesity and related chronic health problems.CLAIM: Mango is better for constipation than fiber supplementsINDUSTRY BACKER: Mango boardREALITY: You would have to eat an entire mango a day to get the slightly better results than 1 teaspoon of Metamucil.CLAIM: Blueberries prevent erectile dysfunctionINDUSTRY BACKER: US Highbush Blueberry Council is oneREALITY: Risk of ED is lowered with eating any fruit. It‚Äôs the flavonoids, or antioxidants, that help.CLAIM: Pomegranates help you cheat death and prevent erectile dysfunction INDUSTRY BACKER: POM WonderfulREALITY: You would have to drink up to four large glasses of pomegranate juice every day to receive an equivalent dose of Urolithin A, a compound in pomegranate that showed healthy qualities in studies. Urolithin A is also found in strawberries, raspberries, almonds and other foods. In addition, POM Wonderful sponsored-research did not test its antioxidant levels against other fruits (which might cost less).Illustrations by Getty ImagesSource: ‚ÄúUnsavory Truth‚Äù and Food Politics blog, both by Marion Nestle.Pomegranates are an example Nestle has taken on for years (originally in The Chronicle). The California company POM Wonderful has spent $35 million on research, she reports, to demonstrate all the potential health benefits you can get from drinking its juice. At one point the company claimed its product would help you cheat death in ads (which were quashed by the Federal Trade Commission). Pomegranates do contain lots of antioxidants, but so do many other fruits.Such promotion of a constantly changing roster of superfoods can give people nutritional anxiety.‚ÄúI tell people to give themselves permission to eat what they like. Just try to control the quantity,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt just makes me cry that people are so anxious about something that is so easily pleasurable.‚ÄùIn a statement, a Mars spokeswoman responded, ‚ÄúWe believe that chocolate is a treat, not a health food. Mars has been doing research on cocoa ‚Äî from plant health to human health for over 25 years and we have not undertaken a study to investigate the health benefits of chocolate for over a decade.‚ÄùMars does continue to conduct research on the health benefits of cocoa flavanols for its CocoaVia dietary supplements, which do contain the  potentially healthy components that are usually destroyed in roasting. The product boasts that it supports heart and brain health ‚Äúby promoting healthy blood flow,‚Äù a claim ‚Äúsupported by 20 years of science.‚ÄùScience, of course, that was paid for by Mars itself."
68.0,"Lately I‚Äôve been evangelizing about my new cooking ethos, which is best characterized as ‚Äúlean out.‚ÄùI spent years of my life leaning in, so to speak, making elaborate recipes. I still don‚Äôt mind doing that occasionally, but the rest of the time ‚Äî the majority of the time ‚Äî I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to wring maximum flavor from a smaller number of ingredients in a shorter period of time. Leaning out: You should try it. It‚Äôs great.And really, summer is the ideal time to pilot your own style of lean-out cooking, because now the markets are loaded with the stuff we dream about eating in January. (And, in foggy San Francisco, the stuff that reminds us of the neighboring sun-soaked farmland.) I‚Äôve been asking myself lately: Should I make (insert elaborate recipe here) with these tomatoes, this corn, these snap peas? Or should I just ‚Ä¶ not? More often, my decision is to leave well enough alone, to cut the tomatoes into wedges and drizzle them with the best olive oil, to boil the corn and lavishly butter it, to eat the snap peas out of hand.But you probably aren‚Äôt reading this to hear me say that the secret to summer cooking is to do nothing. So let‚Äôs do a little something. Let‚Äôs grill thick planks of olive oil-drizzled bread. Let‚Äôs slather them with whipped ricotta. Let‚Äôs wrap belts of prosciutto around halved sweet-tart apricots (or nectarines, or peaches, or figs) and grill those, too, until the prosciutto is crispy and the apricots are jammy. Let‚Äôs sink those into the ricotta, and let‚Äôs sprinkle each toast with some fresh thyme, some flaky salt, maybe a drizzle of honey. Let‚Äôs do less, and let‚Äôs enjoy it more.Jessica Battilana is a San Francisco freelance writer.

71.0,"The Bucklin family‚Äôs relationship with Constellation Brands stretches back more than three decades. That‚Äôs how long Constellation ‚Äî a global wine corporation expected to generate $7.33 billion in revenue this year, and owner of California wine brands like Robert Mondavi and Ravenswood ‚Äî has bought grapes from Old Hill Ranch, the Bucklins‚Äô 35-acre Sonoma Valley vineyard. But after this year‚Äôs wildfires, for the first time ever, Constellation rejected the Old Hill fruit.The reason? Smoke taint.Throughout Wine Country, as the harrowing 2017 harvest  nears its end, small-scale  growers like Bucklin are facing a harsh reality: Wineries may not be willing to buy their product because they don‚Äôt want to sell smoke-tainted wines to consumers. When that happens, it‚Äôs largely not the wineries that take the hit, but the growers.During the earliest hours of the Nuns Fire, flames ripped through Old Hill Ranch, decimating two homes on the property, knocking over more than 40 trees and scorching several century-old vines. Most of Old Hill‚Äôs grapes had been harvested already, but some ‚Äî including the parcels contracted to Constellation ‚Äî remained  on the vines. For days, thick smoke lingered.Constellation‚Äôs smoke-testing process takes on a scientific approach, according to vineyard owner Will Bucklin, looking for the presence of the chemical compounds guaiacol and 4-methylguaiacol, which contribute smoky aromas and flavors. 
                  ‚ÄúThey tested the grapes before they were set to pick and found the compounds present,‚Äù Bucklin said. ‚ÄúAnd they rejected the grapes based on that.‚Äù 
Bucklin does not have crop insurance, which would probably have helped recoup some of his financial losses because of the smoke, on Old Hill Ranch, originally planted in 1852. He‚Äôs planning to get insurance now.To help soften the blow, Bucklin decided to make Constellation‚Äôs rejected fruit into wine himself (in addition to farming the vineyard, he  owns a small, eponymous wine brand), though he‚Äôs  not sure whether he‚Äôll be able to sell it as wine, either bottled or in bulk. Some Cabernet Sauvignon is tasting good, but one of his lots ‚Äî an Alicante Bouschet grape variety ‚Äî is already, as he put it, ‚Äúnasty.‚ÄùIn Napa Valley, grower Maria Haug is  waiting to see whether the last of her fruit, some Roussanne grapes, will be rejected.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just hoping the numbers come in low,‚Äù Haug, who with her husband, Rene, farms a 7¬Ω-acre vineyard in Rutherford, said of the pending smoke-taint analysis. About 90 percent of the Haugs‚Äô grapes had been picked before the wildfires; the final 5 tons of Roussanne were picked Oct. 26. The day before that pick, the winery client (whom Haug did not name)  made Haug sign a contract saying that if the grapes tested positive for high levels of the smoke taint compounds, the winery would not have to pay Haug for the fruit.If the winery does reject the fruit, Haug will take the grapes, vinify them at a custom-crush facility and attempt to sell the wine on the bulk market. ‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt make money that way, we just cut our losses,‚Äù she said.Custom-crush fees come to about $1,000 per ton, she added, plus the costs of pruning, picking and farming; she estimates she might get $1,000 to $1,200 per ton on the bulk market. The Napa County average price of Roussanne, meanwhile ‚Äî the price the winery would pay her ‚Äî was $4,250 per ton last year.
What, precisely, is smoke taint, and how can grapes be tested for it?‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of confusion on the topic, and not a lot of research has been done,‚Äù said Robert Tracy, owner of BevTrac Mobile Quality Systems, a Windsor company that provides quality assurance consulting services to the wine industry. ‚ÄúWhat happens is that when smoke is produced from fire, there are lots of volatile compounds that get in the atmosphere, and there‚Äôs probably eight that could then get into grapes.‚ÄùOf those eight compounds, two ‚Äî guaiacol and 4-methylguaiacol ‚Äî are considered the main smoke taint culprits, and can be tested for. Both can occur in wines normally. They help contribute Syrah‚Äôs signature smoky aroma, for example, and often appear in high concentrations in wines that have been aged in toasted oak barrels.When smoke lingers, guaiacol and 4-methylguaiacol can penetrate grape skins. ‚ÄúThey actually stay in the skin primarily, and sometimes in the pulp,‚Äù Tracy said. However, those volatile compounds can bind to the sugars in the grapes, rendering them nonvolatile. Volatile compounds can be smelled; nonvolatile ones can‚Äôt.According to Tracy, most laboratories can test only for free guaiacol and 4-methylguaiacol. But if the compounds are bound and therefore nonvolatile, neither a laboratory test nor a human nose will detect it. More complications can ensue, because bound compounds can get released later, especially during fermentation. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you can have low levels of the compounds at the juice stage, but higher levels at the wine stage, because the bond between the sugar and the smoke taint chemical is broken,‚Äù Tracy said. Glucosidase enzymes that break those bonds, he added, are present in the human mouth, so it‚Äôs possible that smoke taint compounds can be freed by the  act of tasting.In other words, there may be no way of  telling how much smoke taint will appear in a wine down the road.To make matters  more confusing, no standard definition exists for what constitutes too much guaiacol and 4-methylguaiacol in grapes, and when a winery shouldn‚Äôt make  wine from them. Multiple winemakers cited  0.5 parts per billion as the safe threshold, but Haug believes her winery client will not reject her Roussanne if it tests under 23 parts per billion. (White wines, theoretically, should be at a lower risk of showing smoke taint than reds, because the juice typically spends little time exposed to  grape skins.)For Will Bucklin, the fate of the rejected Constellation grapes is  unclear. Maybe he‚Äôll sell the wines on the bulk market ‚Äî though he doubts that even the bulk market would accept smoke-tainted Alicante Bouschet. Maybe he‚Äôll apply techniques like reverse osmosis, which has been shown to potentially reduce smoke taint, though he‚Äôd consider that a last resort. Maybe the wines will turn out just fine.‚ÄúI really, strongly feel that I want there to be some character about the fire in the wines,‚Äù Bucklin said. ‚ÄúThis is part of the vintage, and it‚Äôs going to be a part of my life, remembering this event. In 10 years, if I sit down and have a bottle of that smoky Cabernet, I want to remember the vintage.‚ÄúAt the same time,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the wines to be disgusting.‚ÄùMaria Haug, meanwhile, counts her blessings. Her family has been farming its vineyard since the 1940s, and in her lifetime she remembers only two vintages ‚Äî one in the early 1970s, the other 2011 ‚Äî where the family had to take a loss on contracted fruit.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs farming, and farming is always a gamble,‚Äù Haug said. ‚ÄúI think a lot of people that are new to the industry may not remember that Napa Valley has had an awful lot of good years.‚ÄùEsther Mobley is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs wine, beer and spirits writer.

"
77.0,"Kosta Browne, the wine brand that defined an era of California Pinot Noir style, is embarking on big changes. This spring, for the first time ever, the Sebastopol winery will open a tasting room ‚Äî  a reversal of its long-held stance of exclusivity. And founders Dan Kosta and Michael Browne, who have been gradually transitioning toward personal projects for years, are officially stepping down from the company.Kosta Browne is among California wine‚Äôs greatest contemporary success stories. What began as two sommeliers‚Äô scrappy garage project in the late 1990s is now a 30,000-case powerhouse with decade-long wait lists. It claims the only Pinot Noir ever awarded as Wine Spectator‚Äôs Wine of the Year. The company has been sold not once but twice to private-equity firms ‚Äî the first time for a reported $40 million, the second time almost certainly for much more.Yet Scott Becker, the winery‚Äôs president and CEO, believes that Kosta Browne must now change or perish. ‚ÄúWe were at the risk of becoming victims of our own success,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTo be relevant and successful for the next 20 years, we have to recognize that the consumer is changing.‚ÄùAs much as Kosta Browne was the paradigm for a new, generous, riper style of Pinot Noir in the mid-aughts, in this decade it has become the establishment against which a younger generation of winemakers rebels.‚ÄúWe got typecast into being this super-extracted Pinot Noir,‚Äù says Dan Kosta. ‚ÄúYou look at (wine organization) In Pursuit of Balance, or the conversation in Oregon. People trying to make a restrained style would use us as an example of what they didn‚Äôt want to do.‚ÄùBecker tells an illustrative story. He and Nico Cueva, Kosta Browne‚Äôs current winemaker, recently visited New York City on a sales trip. They were sitting at the Breslin, a top restaurant where any producer would hope to sell his wine, and Cueva was wearing a T-shirt that said Jolie-Laide ‚Äî the tiny, ultra-hip label from winemaker Scott Schultz, known for oddity wines like Trousseau Gris and Melon de Bourgogne.The Breslin‚Äôs sommelier asked Cueva, ‚ÄúJolie-Laide ‚Äî is that your label? I love those wines.‚Äù No, Cueva responded, it was his friend Scott‚Äôs; he was with Kosta Browne. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Kosta Browne, Cueva repeated.‚ÄúNever heard of it,‚Äù the sommelier shrugged.It was as if Taylor Swift, wearing a St. Vincent T-shirt, had encountered a music producer who loved St. Vincent but had never heard of Swift.‚ÄúAnd the thing hit me right between the eyes,‚Äù Becker says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre up against.‚Äù In an era where top New York sommeliers can recite the ranks of obscure, micro-size Trousseau Gris producers, where does Kosta Browne‚Äôs derided style of ripe Pinot Noir fit in?Did Kosta Browne‚Äôs success make it a scapegoat?Kosta Browne‚Äôs origin ‚Äî which has now become the often-recounted ‚Äútip jar story‚Äù ‚Äî goes like this. In 1997, Dan Kosta and Michael Browne were sommeliers at Santa Rosa‚Äôs John Ash & Co., and mostly broke. They decided to make some wine together. To finance it, every night after their shift, they‚Äôd put $10 in an envelope. When harvest rolled around, they had $800, which bought them a half-ton of Russian River Pinot. To buy a barrel, John Ash chef Jeffrey Madura ponied up $400 ‚Äî their first investor.The two men managed to fundraise from friends and acquaintances over the next few years ‚Äî enough to make 3,600 cases of Lake County Sauvignon Blanc in 1999, and a larger amount of Pinot Noir in 2000. Kosta suggested they call their nascent brand Alterra, ‚Äúhigh earth,‚Äù but one of their investors had already registered a trademark for that name, and threatened to sue them.‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòDan, let‚Äôs just use our names, like Burt Williams and Ed Selyem,‚Äô‚Äù Browne recalls, referring to pioneering Sonoma Pinot producer Williams Selyem. ‚ÄúIt had to be Kosta Browne, though, because ‚ÄòBrowne Kosta‚Äô sounds like a venomous spider.‚Äù Browne would make the wines, Kosta would handle sales and marketing, and their friend Chris Costello would manage the business.Kosta Browne found its stylistic signature in 2002, when they unexpectedly came into some fruit from Sebastopol‚Äôs Kanzler Vineyard at the last minute. Late in the harvest season, the grapes were already at 25.2 brix, a measurement of grape sugar. ‚ÄúI was in this mind-set of, I‚Äôve gotta make Burgundy, I‚Äôve gotta 23.5 it,‚Äù Browne says, referring to the lower sugar levels at which some French winemakers harvest their Pinot Noir. ‚ÄúBut this fruit tasted great. Like a peach I‚Äôd had in Washington state one time ‚Äî that perfectly ripened fruit. We made the wine, and it was just perfectly exhilarating.‚Äù‚ÄúThat turned me on to picking fruit when it tasted good, rather than when people are telling me,‚Äù Browne says. ‚ÄúThe better tasting grapes you get, the better the wine. I‚Äôd never thought about it that way until then.‚ÄùBrowne followed that new mandate the following year, in what turned out to be a hot ‚Äî read: extra-ripe ‚Äî vintage. And it was that vintage, 2003, that proved Kosta Browne‚Äôs breakout. Wine Spectator‚Äôs James Laube awarded its 2003 Kanzler 96 points and its 2003 Sonoma Coast 95, calling the latter ‚Äúone of the greatest Pinot values I‚Äôve ever tasted.‚Äù (It was $28 then; the 2015 bottling of that wine is now $68.)The brand built a strong direct-to-consumer business; it sells only 15 percent of its wine through wholesale. And thanks to Costello, it thrived on limiting customers‚Äô allocations, which helped stoke demand for the wines. Even today at 30,000 cases, Becker says the wait list for the appellation wines is 3.5 years, and 12 years for the 100-case ‚Äú4-Barrel‚Äù cuvee.By 2009, the original set of investors wanted to sell. ‚ÄúWe had friends and family-type investors, they weren‚Äôt gazillionaires,‚Äù Kosta says. ‚ÄúAnd KB was this salmon swimming upstream amid this economic disaster around it.‚Äù Vincraft, a Sonoma investment firm co-founded by Bill Price and backed by the Texas Pacific Group, bought a controlling stake in the winery that year for a reported $40 million. In 2015, Boston private-equity firm J.W. Childs bought Vincraft‚Äôs share.Admittedly, both co-founders have had a foot out the door for a while. ‚ÄúI knew we were going to transact,‚Äù Browne says, and by 2008 he‚Äôd devised ‚Äúa backup plan.‚Äù That was Cirq, a small Sonoma Pinot label, for which J.W. Childs helped Browne secure investors. Meanwhile, Kosta and New Orleans chef Emeril Lagasse co-founded a Sonoma Pinot brand, Alden Alli, named for their wives.When asked why they would want to leave Kosta Browne behind, the co-founders respond as if the shift were preordained. ‚ÄúI equate it with the inevitability of sending your kid off to college,‚Äù Kosta says. They both say they want more freedom, and to be more hands-on with smaller volumes of wine, which Cirq and Alden Alli can afford. Both, however, will continue to share in Kosta Browne‚Äôs success: They remain investors in their namesake company.Curiously, all parties ‚Äî those remaining with Kosta Browne and those leaving it ‚Äî seem eager to distance themselves from the winery‚Äôs reputation for ripe, rich, hedonistic wines.Kosta emphasizes that the Alden Alli wines have ‚Äúless oak, less extraction and a certain savoriness,‚Äù as well as lower alcohol, around 14%. Browne mentions he‚Äôs using more whole-cluster fermentations on the Cirq wines.For the Kosta Browne lineup, meanwhile, Cueva says: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have over-the-top, opulent, blow-your-lid-off wines.‚Äù The head winemaker since 2015, he is using lighter-toast oak, trying native fermentations and experimenting with vessels like foudres. These are techniques you‚Äôd expect from Jolie-Laide, not Kosta Browne.The company‚Äôs 2016 purchase of the 60-acre Cerise Vineyard, a cool-climate Anderson Valley site best known as the source of elegant, lean Pinot Noirs from Littorai Wines, indicates a commitment to these professed stylistic goals.Still, Cueva qualifies those goals. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way that KB‚Äôs going to become some lean, super tannic, acid-driven Pinot Noir. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù (I can confirm it hasn‚Äôt happened; see tasting notes here.)Wine style is one thing; wine business is another. Just as Kosta Browne is trying to position itself as a source of lighter, less extracted wines, so is it trying to win consumers who aren‚Äôt as impressed by limited allocations and exclusivity as an earlier generation.‚ÄúThe consumer is changing,‚Äù says Becker. ‚ÄúLook at the rise of the Whole Foods scene. The influence of the sommelier. Kosta Browne was so successful with the mailing list because people couldn‚Äôt get the wines, but I worry: In the future, will people still be willing to wait for wine?‚ÄùOn the other hand, will chasing experience-hungry Millennials and New York sommeliers alienate the customer base that gave Kosta Browne its success in the first place? The somm at the Breslin may want Trousseau Gris, but I‚Äôd wager the majority of Sonoma Pinot Noir consumers ‚Äî especially those willing to pay $90 for a Kosta Browne wine ‚Äî still like their wines rich and ripe.‚ÄúWe became such a lightning rod for that extracted style, and I don‚Äôt think it was totally fair. Those hot vintages defined us,‚Äù Kosta says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take it. It was great. But we want the right to grow stylistically.‚Äù Esther Mobley is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs wine, beer and spirits writer. E-mail:emobley@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @Esther_mobley"
78.0,"Michelin season has arrived in San Francisco and the Bay Area.On Tuesday, the Michelin Guide unveiled the 2019 edition of its annual Bib Gourmand picks, generally regarded as the French company‚Äôs more affordable recommendations. The main attraction, the list of starred restaurants, will be revealed next Thursday, Nov. 29.Bib Gourmand restaurants are defined by Michelin as ‚Äúrestaurants that offer high-quality food at pocket-friendly prices‚Äù; the price point varies by market, but in the Bay Area, that means two courses and a glass of wine or dessert cost $40 or less, before tax and tip. Bless your heart if you can ‚Äî or want to ‚Äî get out at $40 per person at Kokkari but we digress.Anyway, new to the list (in full below) this year are eight restaurants: Ciccio (Yountville), Dyafa (Oakland), El Molino Central (Boyes Hot Springs), Gran Electrica (Napa), Luna Mexican Kitchen (San Jose), Nyum Bai (Oakland), Soba Ichi (Oakland) and Teni East Kitchen (Oakland). Of those, perhaps the biggest surprise is Luna, mostly because it becomes the sole restaurant from San Jose, a curious signal from Michelin that it‚Äôs trying to canvas the city with a population of more than 1 million and a very rich and broad food scene.For the Bib Gourmands, it brings the total to 68, up from last year‚Äôs crop of 67 restaurants. Off last year‚Äôs list are Aina, Brown Sugar Kitchen (closed), Kappou Gomi, Michel Bistro, Monti‚Äôs, Sir & Star and Tacos Sinaloa.One of the biggest national issues of the last year, the #MeToo movement, did not seem to have an impact, as Coqueta remained on the list.

90.0,"On top of Moon Mountain, at the Gilfillan Vineyard, Scott Knippelmeir kneels to the ground, pulls off the outer layers of a grape vine‚Äôs loose wood, and cuts into its trunk. He‚Äôs checking for signs of life. If the trunk is green, that‚Äôs good: The vine is still alive. If it‚Äôs dry and coffee-brown, that means the vine is dead.Sounds simple enough, except that there are nearly 12,000 individual grape vines at this 6.5-acre vineyard, and each one appears to have suffered a different fate in October‚Äôs Nuns Fire. ‚ÄúThe destruction just seems so ‚Ä¶ random,‚Äù says Knippelmeir, Gilfillan‚Äôs vineyard manager.Indeed, on this late December afternoon, Gilfillan, which is owned by Lambert Bridge Winery, looks simultaneously normal and macabre. Green grass has sprouted between vineyard rows, and the plants have shed their leaves, now bare and ready for winter‚Äôs hibernation. But next to healthy-looking vines are pockets of charred chaparral, blackened manzanitas, collapsed sheds. Melted irrigation hoses droop misshapenly toward the ground, as if in a Salvador Dali painting.Three months after the fires, Knippelmeir and Lambert Bridge winemaker Jennifer Higgins are still trying to assess the damage to Gilfillan ‚Äî and today, they are also trying to form a plan to rehabilitate the burned vines.It took a week after the Nuns Fire had passed through Moon Mountain before surrounding roads were re-opened; Higgins and Knippelmeir rushed up as soon as they were allowed. (All of the vineyard‚Äôs fruit was harvested before the fires.)‚ÄúWe were expecting the worst,‚Äù Higgins says. As they approached, all they could see was burned vegetation.‚ÄúAs soon as we saw that, we knew we were in trouble,‚Äù Knippelmeir says.But it turned out that Gilfillan was largely spared: Only about four percent of the vines died, Higgins estimates.‚ÄúWhen we first got in here, we were going through the rows,‚Äù Higgins says. ‚ÄúWe were looking at the vines ‚Äî green, green, green, then brown ‚Äî saying, ‚ÄòIs there a reason for this?‚Äô‚ÄùAdjacent vines here look completely different: In some cases, a vine‚Äôs rootstock is dead, but the canes at its top still have moist green tissue. Singed leaves don‚Äôt necessarily mean a singed plant. One wooden shed at Gilfillan burned; nearby, another stands intact. The most flammable spot in the entire vineyard ‚Äî where a gas grill and propane tank stand underneath a huge pine tree ‚Äî is, miraculously, unmarred.What saved Gilfillan? The cover crop had been mowed, for one thing, so there wasn‚Äôt much brush between the vine rows to catch fire. There weren‚Äôt weeds growing around the base of each plant. The posts bookending the trellises are metal, not wood.Ultimately, though, no one has a good answer for why one vine burned and another didn‚Äôt. The aftermath of the North Bay Fires has exposed how little we understand about the nexus of fire and vines.‚ÄúNo one knows what‚Äôs the real threshold for heat damage,‚Äù says Rhonda Smith, the Sonoma County-based viticulture farm adviser for the University of California, who has come to Gilfillan to consult on its rehabilitation.Much of the conventional wisdom about how fires interact with vines ‚Äî that vines can‚Äôt burn, because of their high water content, for instance ‚Äî didn‚Äôt turn out to be true for every vineyard, she says.‚ÄúIn 99 percent of cases, vines were fire breaks,‚Äù says Smith. But if there was dry vegetation, if there was wood mulch on the ground, if the soil was especially dry ‚Äî if, if, if ‚Äî then they weren‚Äôt.Now Higgins and Knippelmeir have some decisions to make. Which vines are not salvageable, and have to be replanted entirely? That full replant is the worst-case scenario. It‚Äôs expensive, potentially costing hundreds of dollars per plant ‚Äî more, if the underground risers that support the irrigation system need to be replaced ‚Äî and it could be five more years before a vine is producing fruit.Are there some cases in which the plant looks dead, but the rootstock could be alive? If so, they could leave the rootstock in the ground and simply re-graft in the spring. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôd get fruit from that vine again in 2021,‚Äù Higgins says.If only the canes are dead, Knippelmeir says, the problem could be fixed with simple pruning ‚Äî by cutting off the canes and leaving only spurs. That way, you‚Äôd lose one year of fruit production.‚ÄúOr the big question: do you treat the vine normally and just hope for the best?‚Äù Higgins says. ‚ÄúWondering how it‚Äôs going to wake up ‚Äî that‚Äôs the hardest part.‚ÄùFortunately, Lambert Bridge has insurance on Gilfillan ‚Äî not only crop insurance, which is commonplace and reimburses a grower for the value of its fruit, but also insurance on the vineyard infrastructure itself. That should help with replanting costs.The damage could have been much worse. Even so, ‚Äúthis is farming,‚Äù Higgins says. ‚ÄúYou plan for good years and bad years.‚ÄùAnd while some might find the randomness of the fire‚Äôs destruction frustrating, Rhonda Smith finds it astounding. ‚ÄúThis is an amazing plant,‚Äù she says, pointing at a charred vine. ‚ÄúIt could be injured on one side and fine on the other side, and still do exactly what you need it to do.‚Äù Esther Mobley is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs wine, beer and spirits writer.

96.0,"Elizabeth Simon had no intention of starting a pie company.It all began when Simon, in an effort to impress a guy, decided to bake him a pie.It was the first time she had ever made a pie ‚Äî a classic apple pie. Simon spent the entire day working to create, in her words, ‚Äúthe most beautiful pie‚Äù ‚Äî complete with elaborate latticework and decorative pastry leaves.Unfortunately, things didn‚Äôt go according to plan.‚ÄúI got stood up,‚Äù Simon says. ‚ÄúWe were texting back and forth all day, and he was definitely into this whole process and five minutes before it comes out of the oven, I sent the final text of ‚ÄòCome now; it‚Äôs done!‚Äô‚ÄùThe guy never showed.Rather than get mad, Simon decided to kill him with kindness. Sort of.She had leftover filling and dough, so she made a second, mini version of the pie. But this time, she downloaded an Internet image of a fist with an extended middle finger and used the photo as a template to cut a design into the top crust.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one of those funny things in life, and you can either cry about it or make a f‚Äî you pie and deliver it to his door, which is what I did,‚Äù Simon says with a laugh.Simon‚Äôs girlfriends encouraged her to take the concept a step further.‚ÄúThey were like ‚ÄòOh, you should build a website and you should call it revengepies.org and you should accept stories from San Franciscans and anonymously deliver f‚Äî you pies across the city. You‚Äôd be a superhero,‚Äô‚ÄùSimon recalls.And that‚Äôs how Simon started Revenge Pies (www.revengepies.com).She  started practicing her pie baking skills, sharing the results with friends and colleagues. Eventually, people started asking to buy the pies, but as someone who also held a stressful 9-to-5 job as a concert promoter for AEG Live, this proved a challenge. To keep orders at a minimum, she tried to outprice demand, but that still didn‚Äôt curb the requests.Two years ago, she decided to go all in and began holding pie pop-ups around San Francisco, selling her pies through Uber Eats and even teaching pie-making classes as team-building events for corporations.Simon now oversees a staff of roughly a dozen people ‚Äî mostly women, she points out ‚Äî who turn out hundreds of handmade pies a week at a commercial kitchen space she rents in the Mission. In addition to being a regular at Off the Grid on Friday nights at Fort Mason, four months ago Simon opened a tiny brick-and-mortar location in the Inner Sunset (1248 Ninth Ave.), in a shared space with clothing and custom printing retailer San Franpsycho.For Simon, who is a musician as well as a onetime music promoter, she sees pie as simply another form of creative expression. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an artist who‚Äôs applying my talents in different ways and I‚Äôve always done that. Every project I‚Äôve done throughout my entire life has been eclectic and different.‚ÄùOne of Simon‚Äôs more eclectic creations ‚Äî and proving that revenge is a dish best served cold ‚Äî is what she calls ‚Äúpice cream.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like: Simon folds chunks of her pies ‚Äî such as key lime, blueberry and strawberry ‚Äî into different ice cream bases made for her by Mission gelateria La Copa Loca. The specialty has proved a popular draw for neighborhood locals, as well as visitors heading to and from Golden Gate Park. Up next: adding savory pot pies to her menu.As for that original guy, Simon says he eventually texted back: ‚ÄúThanks for the ‚Äúf‚Äî you pie.‚Äù  They‚Äôre still friends. But that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs important.‚ÄúThis is really the story of how I got stood up and made a company out of it,‚Äù Simon says. "

On the dining-room side, there‚Äôs a mix of booths and tables, wood-grain wainscoting and glittery fabric butterflies pinned to the peach walls. On a recent Tuesday, the restaurant was buzzing with the pleasant murmur of 10 or 12  conversations happening at once. My 7-month-old daughter and I sat at a booth, and I ordered corned beef hash, eggs, hash browns and coffee. Plus a waffle for the baby ‚Äî her first.I don‚Äôt mind when these restaurants  get their corned beef hash from a can. As long as it‚Äôs properly crisped on the griddle, it‚Äôs just a vehicle for ketchup anyway. I do, however, have a pet peeve about sunny-side-up eggs that are gloopy with uncooked whites. Unfortunately, things were particularly gloopy on this particular morning, and my baby‚Äôs waffle was, at best, a pancake in a cheap waffle suit. But the coffee was hot,  the wait staff was kind and the ketchup was Heinz, so all in all, I‚Äôd declare breakfast a success.Later that week, early on a Friday morning, the streets were silent and empty. Swinging open the door of the New Taraval Cafe, however, I found the place packed. The NBA Finals were still on everyone‚Äôs lips. An elderly woman was running through the Warriors‚Äô roster for her dining companion. I overheard ‚ÄúCurry, Durant, McCaw...‚Äù as I slipped past her, headed for the only available table in the back. I made my same order, with the exception of the eggs. Looking to avoid the viscosity of the other morning, I went over-easy rather than sunny-side-up.For some reason, it always takes a visit to a diner to remind me about the fundamental pleasure of chewy, sweet, white toast dipped into a runny egg yolk.¬†I lingered at the table for three cups of coffee, thinking about diners and breakfast and  New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells. Wells had recently written an essay titled ‚ÄúWhy I‚Äôm Not Reviewing Noma Mexico,‚Äù about why he wouldn‚Äôt be visiting or critiquing  renowned restaurant Noma‚Äôs seven-week pop-up in the jungle resort town of Tulum.It might seem, at first glance, like an uncalled-for explanation. After all, why would a New York food critic be reviewing a restaurant in Mexico in the first place?It‚Äôs a good question, and it turns out to be precisely the question that Wells is interested in. His piece is a response to the inordinate number of his colleagues from around the world who made a point of traveling to Tulum to eat at Noma and write about the experience. Wells finds the idea of reviewing Noma Mexico to be ‚Äúspectacularly useless,‚Äù because  it provides no service to his readers to hear about something that was, by design, nearly impossible to experience.Fair enough. But there were elements of Wells‚Äô argument that felt to me like willful ignorance. I mean, isn‚Äôt there something to be said for one of the world‚Äôs foremost food critics knowing what the best restaurant on the planet is up to?Part of Wells‚Äô objection to reviewing Noma Mexico is that he has trouble with ‚Äúthe idea of a meal devoted to local traditions and ingredients that is being prepared and consumed mostly by people from somewhere else.‚Äù I find this kind of parceling out of cultural properties ‚Äî this is Mexican, that‚Äôs Scandinavian; you cook this, and I‚Äôll cook that ‚Äî to be somewhat slippery territory. As with most discussions of this nature, things inevitably come back to what the locals want. Wells asks: ‚ÄúCan a restaurant really be of its place if it doesn‚Äôt bend and sway to the breezes of local tastes and local demands?‚Äù The implicit answer is, no, of course it can‚Äôt. But I can't stop thinking about the suggestion that any of us can, or should, try to represent the needs and desires of communities removed from our own.I‚Äôm new to writing about restaurants. I‚Äôm still figuring out what readers want to read, what I want to write, and whether those two things are ever perfectly aligned. I had the uncommon experience of eating at the Noma pop-up. I‚Äôd be happy to write about it, but I agree with Wells that doing so would prove spectacularly useless.What I do know about this restaurant-writing gig is that I'm supposed to be working in service of the Bay Area and its residents. I shouldn't write about a restaurant that means something to me, if it means nothing to you. But on the other hand, how can I ever properly assign value and context to a place where I'm not a local? I don't live in the Sunset ‚Äî I have no idea why one block needs two restaurants that serve essentially the same menu. I can tell you which of the two I prefer ‚Äî New Taraval Cafe ‚Äî but both places were packed when I visited. I can't explain what compels the residents of the neighborhood to choose one over the other. What they need, or want, is far beyond my critical abilities to determine.I like knowing that New Taraval is my preferred diner in the Sunset. But to find that out, I made a special point of driving across the city on two mornings to have breakfast. I doubt many of you will follow suit. If utility to the broadest possible number of people is the goal, then this bit of restaurant criticism might be a failure. Except that on one of those mornings, as I left the New Taraval Cafe, I spotted a dowdy little restaurant across the street: House of Pancakes. I was flabbergasted by the thought of a third breakfast spot existing on the block, until I realized that the namesake pancakes were not the sort to be bathed in syrup.I returned the next day for a plate of crisp pan-fried pancakes stuffed with ground beef and leeks, a puffy round of sesame bread, thick-skinned pork dumplings and a decent bowl of zha jiang mien. I consider myself fairly well-versed in Chinese pancakes and dumplings, but I was surprised that little of what I ordered looked or tasted the way I‚Äôd expected. If I‚Äôd never made the gratuitous effort to compare two diners in the Sunset, not only would I have remained unaware of which I liked better, but I might also never have known about a quaint little joint to further my education in northern Chinese food. Turns out that what happens on the other side of town ‚Äî or the other side of the planet ‚Äî just might be worth knowing, even if you can‚Äôt see why right away.

124.0,"On my first morning working at Ryan‚Äôs Restaurant in the Castro, Bryan announced that 10 years‚Äô seniority gave him radio rights, which meant the modern country station.Great, I thought. Start cooking at the gayest restaurant in the gayest neighborhood in the country, and I‚Äôm going to spend eight hours a day listening to Shania Freaking Twain.I showed up for my first shift at Ryan‚Äôs in 1995, at the age of 24, with a set of knives I had bought with the next-to-last paycheck from my first real job after college. The research firm that employed me as an admin assistant did fascinating work. I didn‚Äôt. A future spent making copies and formatting proposals made me twitchy and morose.I knew I wanted to do something outside the Financial District, to make things, maybe to have a slash profession: musician/accountant, winemaker/professor. In those days, before I discovered I could write, the first part of the slash meant learning to cook the food I read about in magazines and spent my salary on. I still missed the chaotic thrum of the restaurants that had paid my rent all through college in Minnesota.Right out of college, a few sous-chefs I consulted for advice told me that I should skip culinary school and invest in knives. You‚Äôll learn everything else you need on the job, they said. So I looked for a chef who would hire me, even at minimum wage, and found her at a 14-year-old restaurant whose brunch my friends adored.I took the job in defiance of a previous vow: that I would never cook professionally again.The night before I started my supposedly last kitchen job at a high-volume Italian restaurant in St. Paul, the friend who recruited me issued a warning, his tone both studied and offhand, as if it were a detail that had slipped his mind. The cooks are really homophobic, Irv cautioned, so I told them all that you were gay and you were my friend, and they better not start anything with you.Turned out, Irv had enough charisma that they didn‚Äôt. They did mock all the gay waiters who passed through the kitchen while I bent my head over the salad station, pretending to ignore them. When all the other cooks were on break, the pasta guy would retreat to the opposite side of the hot line rather than talk to me. After four months, and a fryer accident that splattered second-degree burns across my cheeks, I quit. Nothing about the kitchen felt safe.What churned at me was my own willingness to shut up, to look past the cooks‚Äô snide comments and subtle snubs. Hadn‚Äôt I come out at 16, in Indiana? On the campus of my liberal arts college, wasn‚Äôt I the one who treated gender like a set of T-shirts I could shimmy in and out of at will? Fueled by punk bands and Queer Nation chants, didn‚Äôt I stride around the dorm in a skirt and wear earrings that brushed my shoulders?Yet I also knew that my sanctuary  extended only three square blocks, and just how flimsy its protections were. At least once a month, some car would drive on campus and a head would lean out to scream ‚ÄúFaggot!‚Äù I got lucky. The cars never stopped.The Twin Cities was one of the most liberal cities in the country. And yet as soon as I graduated, it felt safer to move to San Francisco, at the height of the AIDS epidemic, than stay in the Midwest.I came to San Francisco not to be gay ‚Äî I could be gay in the Midwest ‚Äî but to be more than gay: to be someone who danced at queer indie clubs and searched for the Mission‚Äôs best pupusa and preferred Bjork to Cher and read Nabokov with friends. I came here, back when it seemed like the most likely place to kill a young gay man, because it was the city where I felt most alive.AIDS had defined my queerness since before I knew I was queer. I was 10 when the news stories about GRID ‚Äî Gay-Related Immune Disorder ‚Äî first reached Indiana. There was no Internet, no ‚ÄúWill & Grace‚Äù and very few out public figures. I sometimes wondered whether that awful junior high joke was true:‚ÄúWhat does Gay mean?‚Äù‚ÄúGot AIDS Yet?‚ÄùBy the early 1990s, retrovirals like AZT were delaying the onset of Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma and the host of illnesses with acronyms we had all memorized, but for too many San Franciscans, they had come too late. As my friend Lon recently wrote, moving to San Francisco then was ‚Äúlike setting up home in the crater from a bomb you narrowly escaped.‚Äù I felt lucky ‚Äî and guilty ‚Äî for being born in 1971. Men 30 years older than me had endured police raids and ostracism to a degree I would never feel. Men 10 years older than me were dying, or watching all their friends die.To be 23, and healthy, felt like I had been given a sacred charge to be happy, to demonstrate to all those car-screamers in the Midwest, not to mention my worried parents, that none of them could predict my fate. It was electrifying to be in San Francisco, too, at a moment when the power of the LGBT community was so evident ‚Äî ACT UP‚Äôs brazen and effective protests, the hundreds of nonprofits we had collectively formed, the height of New Queer Cinema and even, more intimately, the care circles many formed to ease their friends into death.Yet we young gay men, settling into our crater, also absorbed another, tacit message from HIV-prevention posters: to seek love meant baiting the plague. Friends we could trust, lovers we shouldn‚Äôt.Friends visiting San Francisco from other cities called the Castro the Gay Disneyland. To me, the Castro‚Äôs vision of what it meant to be gay felt ossified and tattered, formed in the hedonistic 1970s and almost destroyed by the 1980s. I came to the neighborhood for movies and bookstore readings, but never on a Saturday night.So it was ironic, and another stroke of luck, that I found a job there.Ryan‚Äôs, on 18th Street around the corner from Castro Street, was housed in a three-story Victorian. Downstairs, at the half-basement level, was a deli with prepared salads, charcuterie and the slowest sandwich-making station in town. Slow mostly because Dan, the head of the deli, was such a profligate gossip and when Dan wasn‚Äôt around, none of us could approach his skill. On the middle floor was a tiny bar and waiting room, as well as the kitchen and a hidden back patio. The dining room, a warren of former bedrooms, could be found up another flight.Lenore and Michael Ryan had opened the restaurant in 1980 and it had hit its peak in the mid- to late-1980s. After 14 years, the restaurant was still beloved in the neighborhood for Lenore‚Äôs orange-scented jambalaya, her chocolate pudding cake, her elaborate brunches and Lenore herself. Canary-blonde, buxom, beautiful ‚Äî more precisely, gaw-juss ‚Äî she would faux-scandalize diners with a lascivious crack or envelop them into a pillowy hug. Gay men instantly fell for her.Lenore hired me to work in the mornings with Bryan, prepping salads for the deli, and to step onto the hot line on weekends for brunch and join her catering crew. Ryan‚Äôs menu wasn‚Äôt the greatest food I‚Äôd ever tasted, but it had its heights. By the time I had memorized the words to Garth Brooks‚Äô greatest hits, Bryan had taught me how to make ethereal bread pudding and turn a bunch of scallions into green threads in just a few seconds. I could whisk together an unctuous hollandaise and mix cream biscuits whose recipe I still kick myself for forgetting. Lenore soon gave me control of the Saturday brunch specials, then promoted me to dinner service.The gayest restaurant in the gayest neighborhood in the world was staffed by an extended family of Jaliscans, mostly straight, and LGBT immigrants from places like my hometown. All of us in the latter camp were just looking for a job that let us be gay, and more than gay. As a sanctuary, it was far from ideal, but surrounded by a crew of outcasts, it felt safe enough, and safe enough would have to do.For a few months, while I scuffed up my new knives and learned the choreography of Ryan‚Äôs dinner menu, I got to be the world‚Äôs gayest cook.I would holler ‚ÄúPrincess‚Äù at all the servers and return waiterly shade so fierce it would have hobbled a strongman. We used camp to soften the sting of our insults, and used the sting to keep our defenses from softening. After work, we would trek over to the Pilsner for drinks, me smelling like chicken juices and oxidized garlic.Ryan‚Äôs was also where I learned that, underneath the sickness and the sex, the Castro was more than Gay Disneyland. I‚Äôd spend a few hours in the deli, spelling Dan, and meet local merchants and neighbors. People who lived in the Castro, it turned out, wanted to belong to a place that was alive to their presence. The aspect of restaurant work I had always loved was the camaraderie of the staff. I learned that, especially in long-running restaurants like Ryan‚Äôs, the camaraderie extended to patrons as well.Sunday brunch and the occasional 800-person event could still turn Ryan‚Äôs kitchen into an adrenaline corral, but by 1996 the restaurant was tired. The dining room chairs looked like they‚Äôd been strafed by pellet guns, and the saucepans were permanently, thickly covered in carbon. Catering kept the business alive, but the Ryans were weary of owning a restaurant.Michael confided to me once that they had also grown weary of death ‚Äî both customers and staff. Bryan developed lung cancer during my year and moved to Ohio to die. HIV had hacked the fat off another co-worker, Tom, but had left him sturdy enough to care for his best friend, who grew more shambling over the year, barely able to wheel his oxygen tank down the street to visit the restaurant, until he died, too.In the fall of 1996, 10 months after I started, the Ryans sold the business to a wealthy patron who had never worked in the food industry but loved the idea of owning a restaurant. We greeted the news as a betrayal. Lenore could assure us as much as she wanted, but we all knew that when the soul of a place departs, the body is soon to follow.When I think of those last couple of months at Ryan‚Äôs, when we all waited for it to die, one night comes to the fore. For decades, in fact, it was the only memory of that year I held at the ready: the night I realized the world had just changed.Two waiters wandered into the kitchen to pick up their orders. ‚ÄúSo he began taking this mix of drugs he‚Äôs calling a cocktail,‚Äù one told the other. ‚ÄúOne minute he‚Äôs on death‚Äôs door, and the next, he‚Äôs gained weight, his T-cells have gone up. He looks almost normal.‚Äù For 15 years, AIDS had been equated with certain death. Retroviral cocktails would change what it meant to have HIV ‚Äî even more broadly, what it meant to be a gay man.By the winter of that year, I was working at another restaurant with a pack of burly straight guys who didn‚Äôt give a damn who I slept with as long as my risottos got to the window in time. In exchange, I feyed down. I barked out orders. My shoulders and hips stiffened up. At times, it felt as comfortable as a wool caftan on bare skin, but I liked them, this new crew, and my new chef was turning me into the cook I wanted to be.Reports from Ryan‚Äôs were filtering back: The new owners were running the restaurant into the ground.The Castro, meanwhile, was coming back to life.

129.0,"Editor‚Äôs note: Welcome to All Consuming, a new kind of Chronicle restaurant review column by Chris Ying, a San Francisco writer, editor and diner. This regular midweek series will explore the breadth of dining in the Bay Area. Enjoy.I‚Äôm new. Not new to town ‚Äî not a native, either ‚Äî but new to this newspaper.I‚Äôve called San Francisco home for the better part of two decades. I‚Äôm quick to defend the city and eager to point out why I‚Äôd rather live and eat here than New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or the rich, white part of Orange County where I grew up.I love that San Francisco restaurants are brave, even when they are stupidly so. I love our fanatical artisans and eccentric winemakers, our markets and the farmers that supply them. While our city has never had the same dazzling reputation for its immigrant-run restaurants as, say, Los Angeles or Houston, I love that there are still revelations of all kinds to be had around the Bay Area. I look for authentic experiences over authentic cuisine anyway.But San Francisco is changing ‚Äî that‚Äôs plain enough to see. It‚Äôs a city perpetually tumbling across savage and contradictory currents. It‚Äôs not the same place it was when I moved here, or the same place it was 10 years before that. ‚ÄúYou should have seen it when ‚Ä¶‚Äù is the rueful mantra of all San Franciscans.It dawns on me that it‚Äôs been a long time since I really took stock of the city. I‚Äôm hoping that writing this regular restaurant column will be my opportunity to make sure the quirks and qualities that drew me to San Francisco are still here in some form.Frankly, I‚Äôve always shied away from reviewing restaurants, but that‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt see the value in thoughtful criticism. I believe that a good food critic not only steers diners toward better meals, but also helps restaurants see themselves more clearly. As for my specific purview, I think a San Francisco-based critic would do well to consider the wider world of eating, whether by expanding the range of restaurants we consider worth writing about; by bringing more of the North, South and East Bay into the fold; or by discussing the city‚Äôs restaurants in a global context. Anyway, that‚Äôs what I told my editor I‚Äôm going to attempt to do here.But before we get to all that, let me lay my cards on the table:I‚Äôve lived in the Bay Area for 17 years ‚Äî San Francisco proper for all but two of those. I came for school but spent the majority of my college days working as a line cook at a now-closed Berkeley restaurant called Downtown. I kept cooking for a little while after school ‚Äî notably with friends who opened one of the first pop-ups in America, Mission Street Food ‚Äî but I stopped, because I wasn‚Äôt talented enough to pursue it seriously. For seven years I worked at San Francisco‚Äôs best-loved and starriest-eyed publishing house, McSweeney‚Äôs. Then in 2011 I met a writer and a chef from New York, and I left to start a food magazine with them called Lucky Peach.A good percentage of my time in the Bay Area has been spent in the company of chefs. I call some of them friends, and I‚Äôm friendly with others. I‚Äôve had meals at their restaurants at their expense, traveled and cooked with them, and written and edited their cookbooks. If I walk into Mission Chinese Food, Tartine Manufactory, Saison, Coi or In Situ, I will most likely know someone working there and they will know me.On numerous occasions in the past six years, I‚Äôve taken up festival organizers and tourism agencies on offers to travel to foreign countries to speak at conferences, or, more often, just to mess around.I mention all this partly as a sort of offense-is-the-best-defense strategy. I‚Äôm hoping to avoid anyone complaining later that I lied about my objectivity or my professional entanglements. (Suffice to say, I will always be transparent about those, and I won‚Äôt accept any freebies for this column.) But I also mention it because I think that the breadth of my dining experiences and my affinity with industry folk make me specially qualified to tell you about what‚Äôs good to eat.I find it instructive to see Danny Bowien leading a ragtag pack of friends up a steep section of Jones Street to Shalimar, rhapsodizing all the way about the smoky, spicy goat curry that awaits us. I love that he orders an extra portion so he can Cryovac it and bring it back with him to New York.It fills me with equal parts shame and delight that right under my nose at Hamano, my neighborhood California-rolls-and-chicken-teriyaki Japanese restaurant, there was a chef named Jiro Lin making sushi with such skill and diligence that one of his regulars, Saison chef Joshua Skenes, lured him out of relative obscurity to open a spectacular but short-lived omakase counter of his own. (Jiro is back at Hamano, by the way, serving what is probably the best sushi in San Francisco.)So if you‚Äôll forgive me for bending and breaking some of the cardinal rules of restaurant criticism, I‚Äôll continue to be honest and forthright about why and how I like to eat in the Bay Area.Here, as a gesture of good faith, are some bits of wisdom I‚Äôve accrued over the years but largely kept to myself:I‚Äôm convinced that continuing to list the boat noodles and congee only in Thai on a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù chalkboard menu is a gimmick at this point, but I forgive the staff of Zen Yai (771 Ellis St.) because they don‚Äôt blink when I order an extra half-bowl of noodles to round out my lunch.My favorite birthday cake is the tres leches from the Mission‚Äôs Dragon City Bakery (2367 Mission St.).My go-to orders are the No. 26 (dry pho) at Pho Tan Hoa (431 Jones St.) and the No. 5 at Cordon Bleu (1574 California St.) ‚Äî plus an extra imperial roll ‚Äúfor my wife.‚ÄùStreet cred dictates that I say I like the tacos best at La Taqueria (2889 Mission St.), but my heart really beats for, and with more difficulty because of, the burrito. My order: carnitas (and chorizo, if I‚Äôm feeling self-destructive) and the green salsa, not the red; cooked dorado.The pan-fried daikon cake at Koi Palace (365 Gellert Blvd., Daly City) is a solid rendition of a dim sum classic, but the real revelation and my particular jam is the steamed version.You should already know to add a little spice to your burger by requesting a bag of unadvertised pickled chiles from behind the counter at In-N-Out. I order them chopped and slipped into my double-double ‚Äî they‚Äôll also chop the raw white onions for you, if you want ‚Äî along with extra-well-done fries.They have different numbers on their respective menus but the house noodles (Hu Tieu Nghiep Ky and Hu Tieu Hai Ky) at Thai Nghiep Ky Mi Gia (1427 Noriega St.) and Hai Ky Mi Gia (707 Ellis St.) are essentially the same dish: wide rice noodles in a light, fishy broth, with ground and sliced pork, pork offal, shrimp crackers, and fish balls that are heavily dosed with white pepper. Many regulars opt for the braised duck leg with egg noodles (soup on the side), but the house specialty speaks to me on a primal level.It‚Äôs Teochew food, from a southeastern province of China where my great-grandmother lived, as well as the babysitter who watched me when I was a toddler. The first thing I can remember eating is a bowl of fat, slippery rice noodles with minced pork and fish balls. Maybe it‚Äôs psychosomatic, but with very little effort, I can conjure the acrid-sweet smell of said babysitter‚Äôs Chinese cigarettes and imagine those noodles exactly as they were.If the same blend of pork and fermented fish sauce and nostalgia speaks to you, I think we‚Äôll get along fine.

144.0,"Following the recent 7.1-magnitude earthquake in Mexico City, chef Gabriela Camara ‚Äî who as a child experienced the 8.1 earthquake in 1985 in Mexico City that killed thousands ‚Äî hosted a fundraiser for relief efforts at her San Francisco restaurant, Cala. At sister restaurant Contramar, which is located in Mexico City‚Äôs badly damaged Condesa neighborhood, Camara worked with employees to coordinate meals for volunteers and rescue workers.More recently in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, chef Jose Andres and his team from World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit founded by Andres following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, have been on-site working to feed thousands.This week, as epic fires raged in Northern California, nearly every single Bay Area chef rallied in some way to help the people of Sonoma and Napa, whether through food deliveries, fundraisers or other aid.These chefs, and others like them, are doing what they can to  help  these refugees of disaster who are in a seemingly helpless situation.The same could be said of a group of San Francisco women back in 1906 who compiled a collection of recipes for ‚ÄúThe Refugees‚Äô Cook Book‚Äù following the infamous San Francisco earthquake that struck at 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906, and fire.According to California food historian Erica J. Peters, the book was a tool for people to feel connected.‚ÄúLike they‚Äôre giving to a good cause by buying or producing something within their own skill-set. They don‚Äôt know how to build buildings, but they know how to make a cookbook,‚Äù Peters says.According to the cover of the book, which is housed in UC Berkeley‚Äôs Bancroft Library‚Äôs 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire Digital Collection, it was compiled by refugees ‚Äúfor the benefit of those who have lost their cookbooks in our great disaster,‚Äù although Peters points out that it‚Äôs not clear if that was reality or simply savvy marketing.‚ÄúA real refugee is not cooking in their tents; they‚Äôre getting served by soup kitchens,‚Äù says Peters. For those  who still had a house standing, most likely it was their servants cooking in the streets with makeshift kitchen setups, because for weeks there was no indoor cooking for fear of fire or other disaster. Dinner would then be served inside on china plates.Wherever people ate, one thing is fairly certain: Mealtime provided a moment of sanity and some semblance of normalcy during a very trying time.‚ÄúFood was the one thing that worked to make people feel the sky wasn‚Äôt falling,‚Äù Peters says.Charity cookbooks, which experienced a big boom around the Civil War as part of fundraising efforts for veterans, were fairly commonplace at the time.People‚Äôs attitudes toward food in early 20th century San Francisco weren‚Äôt that different from ours today, says Peters. There was a strong interest in fresh food, and thanks to heavy immigration, there was also a great deal of interest in cuisines from different cultures. The cookbook‚Äôs inclusion of recipes such as Italian Spaghetti and Spanish Meatballs reflects this attitude.Take, for example, a recipe for Chippine, which from its description is obviously a variation of cioppino ‚Äî a dish that remains greatly beloved by modern San Franciscans. First documented in print in 1901 by journalist Harriet Quimby, by 1906 the dish had already gained enough popularity to be featured in the cookbook.The recipe reads:‚ÄúTake a good sized solid piece of fish (bass or white fish) put in a pot with one can of tomatoes, one onion sauted in butter, two pepper pods, one bay leaf, juice of one dozen clams, cook briskly one hour; fifteen minutes before serving add one dozen clam bellies.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dish you make with what you have on hand. It‚Äôs not fancy food,‚Äù Peters says.As San Francisco recovered from the devastation, food moved beyond sustenance and comfort. Beginning with the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, which served as a flag to let the world know San Francisco was back in business, local foods like cioppino, sourdough and chop suey played a large part in the city‚Äôs efforts to rebuild itself and woo hesitant travelers to spend time (and dollars) here.As Peters puts it: ‚ÄúFood became part of the story of why you would come to San Francisco.‚Äù Sarah Fritsche is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

149.0,"The first time I knew I loved Japantown was Aug. 23, 2011. A friend and I were wandering around the western end of the Japan Center in search of a drink. It was probably 10 p.m. and the mall was basically closed, but in a fluorescent-lit corner on the second floor, in an otherwise empty corridor, we saw an open door and walked into Mogura.It was dim inside. The walls in the front of the room were dressed to look like stone; everywhere else was lined with faux bamboo. A long, continuous, staple-shaped bench wrapped around the bar, and four businessmen were seated in a row with satisfied smiles and the relaxed posture of perfectly buzzed drinkers. We found a seat on a short end of the staple and ordered two Sapporos. The other patrons gave us a quick nod and then returned their attention to the thick binders of karaoke song choices in front of them. One guy handed his selection to the bartender on a slip of paper the size of a fortune-cookie fortune, and the bleep-bloopy MIDI version of an unfamiliar Japanese tune started up. The man sang along from his seat at the bar, then passed the mike to his neighbor when he was finished.After a few more too-expensive beers, my friend and I worked up the nerve to join the musical fray, and tried our best not to kill the vibe with our interpretations of John Denver and Jay-Z. Eventually the bar‚Äôs owner came out from the back to have a peek at the newcomers. She wore a kimono and her hair was locked in a swooping vertical salute, like Cameron Diaz in ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Something About Mary.‚Äù My friend and I waved and got a smile in return. We stuck around for a couple hours, singing duets with our new pals and thanking our lucky stars that we‚Äôd decided to see what was going on upstairs in Japantown. At some point, I snapped a blurry photo so I could remember the exact date forever.I returned to Mogura many times, learning a little bit more about it with each visit. I heard other patrons refer to the owner as Mama-San, and found out she ran another bar in the back called Club Mari, an invitation-only place. It‚Äôs a hostess bar, Yelp whispered. I always stuck to the front room, but would try to sneak a peek into Club Mari whenever I passed by on my way to or from the restroom. I spent my birthday at Mogura and encouraged friends to do the same.One night, a year or two later, I sat at the bar with a few friends and asked to see the karaoke book. The bartender explained politely that there was no more karaoke. They didn‚Äôt have an entertainment permit, she said, so they weren‚Äôt doing it anymore. I looked quizzically toward the blinking blue and green lights of the karaoke equipment and the dizzying screen saver playing on the television, and realized that I‚Äôd ruined paradise.This is how I experienced Japantown in my 20s (and early 30s) ‚Äî as a destructive voyeur indulging in the kitsch and decadence. We‚Äôd gorge on shabu shabu and test the limits of the all-you-can-drink policy at Cafe Mums. We used to sing karaoke at Do Re Mi, until we discovered Town Music down the street and its carefree attitude about what goes down in its rooms. My friend fell off the Peace Pagoda one night, and I‚Äôve been asked to leave Dimples. If you‚Äôve been to Dimples, you understand what it takes to get kicked out of Dimples. Two or three times a year, we‚Äôd go to Benihana. Danny Bowien introduced me to YakiniQ, the all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue joint across the street from the mall, and for a little while that‚Äôs where we‚Äôd go eat and drink too much. (Quick side note: My belief is that AYCE K-BBQ places can only stay decent for a couple months ‚Äî beyond that, they begin to crumble under the pressure of serving that much meat and that much soju to that many drunk kids.) I feel guilty about all of this. San Francisco‚Äôs Japantown is one of the only remaining in the country. It‚Äôs a place with history ‚Äî a history that includes earthquakes, migration, internment, displacement and a sizable community. But I only ever went there to scratch an itch for beer and teppanyaki. In my defense, I don‚Äôt know anyone else who has spent as much time trying to know Japantown. When Noboru Inoue was still slicing fish at Ino Sushi, Danny and I used to bring him his favorite mushroom-and-anchovy pizza to get on the good side of his notoriously grumpy demeanor. I‚Äôve found more utility than joy in curry at On the Bridge, the sushi boat at Isobune, packaged meals from Nijiya, and the washoku and equally bad yoshoku food at Mifune. The ramen around Japantown has always been subpar, too.Until Marufuku. The shop opened a little more than a month ago, right next door to Club Mari, in the former Sapporo-ya space. (Both signs were still up when I was there last week.) Marufuku specializes in variations on two bowls: chicken paitan and Hakata-style tonkotsu ramen. Both paitan and tonkotsu are rich soups that appear cloudy-white from the long, hard cooking of pork or chicken bones. Hakata-style usually implies thin noodles and pork broth. (Ippudo, if you‚Äôre familiar, is basically a Hakata-style shop.) Paitan is similar, but with chicken broth. I tend to think of paitan and tonkotsu as low-hanging fruit. It‚Äôs much easier to hide mistakes or shortcuts in a sticky, fatty bone broth than in a light, clear dashi or chicken broth. (I‚Äôm told that Hinodeya, a new shop around the corner from the Japan Center, specializes in dashi ramen, and I‚Äôm keen to check it out.) But neither of the broths at Marufuku are crazy heavy, which is my other issue with most tonkotsu or paitan soups. The tonkotsu lacks any of the stink that can arise from simmering unrinsed or low-quality pork bones. It‚Äôs not especially porky, in fact, and the paitan doesn‚Äôt taste that strongly of chicken, either. But they‚Äôre both solid, balanced soups, rich but not fatty, salty and a little seaweed-y.The noodles at Marufuku are thin, chewy and slurpable. Ivan Orkin, my ramen shaman, has noted on numerous occasions that the hallmark of a well-crafted bowl is when the noodles and broth stick to one another as you suck them up into your mouth, and this seems to be the case at Marufuku. Neither of the bowls is overly outfitted with toppings (though I wouldn‚Äôt mind if every shop outside of Hokkaido stopped serving corn kernels in its ramen). Each has a soft-boiled egg, nori, bean sprouts, sliced kombu, scallions and the aforementioned corn. The tonkotsu is ornamented with thin slices of pork belly, and the paitan comes with sweet, chewy pieces of chicken breast (a.k.a. ‚Äúchicken chashu‚Äù). An order of paitan DX includes a soy-braised chicken leg on the side. The chicken sits atop a bed of wilted but crunchy bean sprouts, and comes with no indication of how you‚Äôre meant to eat it with your ramen. Think of it like the tow package on a new SUV: nice to have, probably not necessary. The rest of the menu has some nooks worth exploring. A small rice bowl on the side will put you over from full to almost uncomfortably full, but both the spicy cod roe and the pork belly bowls are worth a ride. The Marufuku salad is refreshing and gently bitter, with a sweet plum dressing that smacks pleasantly of shiso. There are still a few bolts to be tightened, of course. I‚Äôm not a fan of the pickled ginger spears that come atop the tonkotsu ‚Äî for me, they take the soup from ramen back to its roots as Chinese noodle soup. Both broths could come hotter, as they could almost everywhere else in the city. The karaage is dry and the crust looks mottled, like chocolate chip cookie dough. And I didn‚Äôt love that all my food arrived at once, as it forced me to strategize about how to proceed in a sequence that would prevent my noodles from overcooking in the broth: Leave the salad undressed, sacrifice the rice bowl, ignore the chicken leg, start with the ramen. I‚Äôm grateful for Marufuku. It‚Äôs a convincing reason to eat in Japantown, and it gives me hope for the possibility of further upgrades in the Japan Center. On my two recent visits, I sat down, I had ramen, and I left happily. I didn‚Äôt even glance in the direction of Mogura. "
151.0,"There‚Äôs a lot happening in the world right now to make us crave comfort, so it‚Äôs no shocker that hygge ‚Äî the Danish concept of all things cozy and comforting ‚Äî has spiked on the trend-o-meter.For Kristen Rasmussen, that feeling of hygge can be found in a simple bowl of porridge.Rasmussen is a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), an avid forager and the founder of Rooted Food, a consulting company focused on nutrition. Growing up, she loved to cook and contemplated going to culinary school. Instead, she ended up studying nutrition and science in college because it was, in her words, a ‚Äúcool way to talk about food all day ‚Äî and have more job potential.‚ÄùShe spent nearly a decade teaching food science classes at UC Berkeley and the Culinary Institute of America (Greystone), in addition to consulting for Bon Appetit Management Co. and Cal Dining. But for the past six months, she‚Äôs turned her gaze once more to cooking by hosting hygge-inspired porridge pop-ups in the East Bay.Rasmussen has always enjoyed the occasional bowl of hot cereal for breakfast, yet she didn‚Äôt become obsessed with porridge until several years ago, when she spent two months working in Copenhagen as a visiting researcher at the Nordic Food Lab.During her stay, she happened upon a porridge-focused restaurant called Gr√∏d, named after the Danish word for ‚Äúgruel.‚Äù‚ÄúIn America, our visions of porridge are oatmeal, and you kind of eat it because you have to,‚Äù says Rasmussen.This was not the case at Gr√∏d. The restaurant served sweet and savory porridge dishes made with a variety of grains ‚Äî rye, oats, quinoa and more ‚Äî and creative toppings like fermented rhubarb, pea shoots, toasted hazelnuts, molasses and skyr, a Nordic cultured dairy product similar to yogurt.‚ÄúIt made you excited about porridge,‚Äù says Rasmussen.Like hygge, Nordic cuisine has grown in popularity in recent years. Rasmussen sees the popularity of both as symbolic of people‚Äôs desire to unplug, slow down and find comfort in an increasingly busy world.For Rasmussen, who is of Danish descent, her porridge pop-ups are a way to connect to her family‚Äôs heritage as well as to link her love of cooking, nutrition and foraging. And in the meantime, she gets to test out a potential new career path.She has pared back her full-time teaching schedule to focus more on her pop-ups, which she named after her Danish great-grandfather, Rasmus. Her cooking style ‚Äî she describes it as ‚ÄúWest Coast Nordic‚Äù ‚Äî may be inspired by her roots, but it‚Äôs strongly influenced by California ingredients and flavors.For her porridge creations, Rasmussen sources grains from Berkeley‚Äôs Millet Project, a campus research group devoted to studying and reintroducing the ancient grain. She also loves to make porridge variations with buckwheat and a blend of nine organic grains from Central Milling.Toppings vary seasonally, and in keeping with her love of wild foods, they include plenty of foraged ingredients found around the Bay Area like feral rhubarb, dandelion greens, nasturtiums, wood sorrel, edible flowers and bay nuts (bay nuts are found on California bay laurel trees, and like bay leaves, are edible; when roasted, they take on a coffee/cacao flavor). She rounds out the rest of her foraged finds with produce from local growers like Top Leaf Farms, which specializes in farming on East Bay rooftops.Rasmussen acknowledges that it‚Äôs a bit of a challenge to sell porridge as a concept for a potential restaurant, so to round out the business, she‚Äôs also planning to add sm√∏rrebr√∏d (Danish open-faced sandwiches) to the mix.‚ÄúYou start thinking about it, and every culture has a porridge,‚Äù says Rasmussen. ‚ÄúIt's just a very comforting food.‚Äù Sarah Fritsche is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

154.0,"With To Kalon, it‚Äôs never over.Located in western Oakville, the 450-acre To Kalon Vineyard is the source of some of Napa Valley‚Äôs most expensive and acclaimed wines from producers like Opus One, Schrader, Paul Hobbs, MacDonald and Robert Mondavi.Last summer, Constellation Brands, which owns the Robert Mondavi Winery, filed three new trademark applications tied to the area: ‚ÄúTo Kalon Wine Company,‚Äù ‚ÄúTo Kalon Vineyard Company‚Äù and ‚ÄúRooted in To Kalon.‚Äù The company planned to use ‚ÄúTo Kalon Wine Company‚Äù for a new brand it will release  with superstar winemaker Andy Erickson.Now comes word that Constellation has abandoned all three trademark registrations.Why? Constellation did not respond to requests for comment, but signs point to a desire to avoid another legal confrontation with Andy Beckstoffer, who owns a portion of the To Kalon Vineyard and who has challenged Mondavi on its To Kalon trademarks before.Although six parties own portions of this famous property, only one ‚Äî Robert Mondavi Winery ‚Äî owns the rights to its name. In 1988 and 1994, respectively, Mondavi registered trademarks for ‚ÄúTo Kalon‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo Kalon Vineyard.‚Äù But Beckstoffer wanted his winery clients to be able to use the name To Kalon on their bottles too. He and his client Schrader Cellars took Mondavi to court.Beckstoffer‚Äôs argument was simple: ‚ÄúI believe that a vineyard is a place, not a marketing concept,‚Äù he wrote in one of the lawsuits. If you can‚Äôt claim exclusive rights to a name like ‚ÄúCalifornia,‚Äù the reasoning goes, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to hold a trademark on To Kalon, which has been recognized as a vineyard ‚Äî therefore, as a place ‚Äî for 150 years.Mondavi and Beckstoffer settled out of court in 2003. Beckstoffer was granted a royalty-free license of Mondavi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTo Kalon‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo Kalon Vineyard‚Äù trademarks; any winery that buys fruit from Beckstoffer‚Äôs portion of To Kalon can say so on its wine label. It may have been a victory ‚Äî at least a partial one ‚Äî for Beckstoffer‚Äôs business interests, but the lawsuits did little to resolve the question of To Kalon‚Äôs primary identity: land or brand?This time, it looks like Beckstoffer wasn‚Äôt going to let Mondavi get away with three additional trademarks. He managed to get the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to extend the period of opposition to the new trademarks ‚Äî originally supposed to end in July of 2017 ‚Äî to October. And then, on Sept. 26, Constellation abandoned all three of the new trademark applications. (Beckstoffer, too, declined to comment.)The new wine brand, to be made by Andy Erickson, will forge ahead ‚Äî but what it will be called is anybody‚Äôs guess.Did the prospect of another legal battle with its neighbor just seem like bad PR for Constellation? Was it ruled to be a bird-in-the-hand situation ‚Äî might Constellation worry that another lawsuit could endanger its claim to the two original To Kalon trademarks?Which brings us to the second  recent To Kalon-related development. The creek that runs through the To Kalon Vineyard is now officially named To Kalon Creek, thanks to a proposal that Graeme MacDonald, whose family owns a section of the vineyard, submitted to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. This makes it possible for the words ‚ÄúTo Kalon‚Äù to appear on a map for the first time in the vineyard‚Äôs 150-year history.MacDonald ‚Äî who sells his To Kalon fruit to Mondavi and keeps a small amount for his family‚Äôs own MacDonald wine brand ‚Äî is now putting together a proposal for the National Register of Historic Places and the Historic American Landscapes Survey (both of which operate under the National Park Service). His hope is that To Kalon will be recognized as the historic place that it is ‚Äî in a way, to borrow Beckstoffer‚Äôs language, that transcends marketing concepts.Naming a small creek may sound insignificant, but ‚Äúyou‚Äôve gotta take the slow steps,‚Äù MacDonald says. ‚ÄúThis is about building a foundation for the future of great vineyards in America.‚ÄúI am hopeful this process will be a precedent for vineyard designation policy in the future and encourage stewardship of other historic agricultural sites around the Napa Valley,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf this is the first one to get recognized, just think of what could follow.‚ÄùWhat could follow, potentially: a decisive interpretation of the To Kalon name as a place before a brand. The names board  approval implies this interpretation already. Since it won‚Äôt approve names that constitute a ‚Äúpromotion of commercial activities,‚Äù MacDonald had to argue that the creek was named not for a trademark that Mondavi had made famous, but for the concept of To Kalon as a geographic place that had existed long before Robert Mondavi arrived there.If this interpretation holds, what might be the fate of Mondavi‚Äôs trademarks?As I said, with To Kalon, it‚Äôs never over."
155.0,"As January nears its conclusion, how are you doing with your New Year‚Äôs health resolutions? How‚Äôs your willpower holding up on that keto diet? Are those probiotic supplements making your gut happy?These new and shiny health trends have skyrocketed in popularity. Celebrities sing the praises of stunt diets and esoteric supplements. Intermittent fasting, it seems, has become big with the local tech bro scene.Me, I‚Äôve never been one for resolutions, especially the dietary kind, because, hey, I work in food. (I also don‚Äôt like other people telling me what I should and shouldn‚Äôt eat.)That said, for a few weeks now, I‚Äôve been following an anti-inflammatory diet. Currently I am avoiding booze, bread, pasta and processed sugar; basically, all of the tasty things that make life fun. The thing is, I‚Äôm actually feeling better. I‚Äôm not certain of the reason, but my joints seem to be aching less, I‚Äôm sleeping better and have more energy. Still, I miss doughnuts.When it comes down to it, we all want to feel better, and what we put in our bodies (or don‚Äôt) is a big part of that. However, making heads or tails of these diet and health trends can be mind-boggling.I recently spoke with Danica Cowan, M.S./R.D., a registered dietitian and nutritionist at UCSF‚Äôs Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, to learn more about these trends ‚Äî what they are, what works and what is plain old marketing hooey.The ketogenic dietProbably the highest profile diet right now is the ketogenic diet, or keto for short. By consuming foods that are high in fat and minimizing carbohydrate intake, it‚Äôs designed to get the body to burn fats instead of carbs, and to reach a metabolic state known as ketosis.However, there are two kinds of ketogenic diets, says Cowan: the one used to treat certain medical conditions, and the fad type used for weight loss.The medical diet, which has been around for decades, was originally intended to treat pediatric epilepsy and can be pretty effective for that, Cowan says. There‚Äôs also a lot of emerging research about the ketogenic diet and its effect on lowering inflammation in the brain, as well as diabetes.As for the fad diet, however, casual fad dieters are probably not in ketosis; instead, most people may simply be on a low-carb diet with extra fat.In general, the ketogenic diet is not intended to be followed for a long period of time, says Cowan, and as such, researchers don‚Äôt fully know yet the long-term effects that the diet may have.‚ÄúThe thing that makes me nervous about the keto diet is the unlimited permission to eat all the fats they want, including unhealthy fats,‚Äù says Cowan.So, before you reach for that extra helping of bacon ‚Äî which Cowan reminds us is not a health food ‚Äî it‚Äôs important to work with an experienced dietitian or nutritionist who understands the keto diet, ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre basically changing the way your body functions.‚ÄùIntermittent fastingExactly what it sounds like, intermittent fasting is a catch-all term that can mean everything from going without food for a couple of days a month to simply lengthening the amount of time between finishing dinner and eating breakfast.For those of us who love food and take pleasure in eating, the idea of fasting may seem extreme, but Cowan believes there are potential benefits in this approach.Having more time between meals allows the body more time to rest and repair itself. The routine‚Äôs flexibility means that it can be relatively easy for people to incorporate it into their daily schedule. Even if you decide that intermittent fasting isn‚Äôt for you, Cowan does encourage people to stop eating about two to three hours before bed.Gut healthWander the aisle of your neighborhood market and you‚Äôll spot all sorts of foods and drinks touting that they‚Äôre infused with probiotics and prebiotics. But what exactly are probiotics and prebiotics, and what do they do?Probiotics are live bacteria that are ingested with the intention that they will take up residence in your intestines. Prebiotics are the food for the probiotics and can be found in high-fiber sources like fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains. As a result of eating prebiotics, probiotics produce short-chain fatty acids, which have beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal system.As for all those energy bars, cereals and other prepared foods that are marketed as being loaded with pre- and probiotics, Cowan recommends approaching those with a healthy dose of skepticism.‚ÄúMost food marketing is b.s.; some have science behind it; 95 percent of it is marketing,‚Äù says Cowan. ‚ÄúAdding something healthy to something unhealthy does not make it healthy.‚ÄùGenerally speaking, Cowan recommends using refrigerated supplements over shelf-stable ones, and ideally, they should have at least 10 strains of different bacteria. To have an impact, they also have to be taken regularly.Other sources that are great for promoting a more gut-friendly diet: fermented foods, especially yogurt (plain and unsweetened), kimchi, sauerkraut, lacto-fermented pickles and kefir. Kombucha, which contains a lot of yeasts, can be problematic for some people with gastrointestinal concerns. (It is, however, a good replacement for soda.)What a lot of these diets have in common, says Cowan, is cutting out unhealthy foods. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, if you‚Äôre eating more whole, unprocessed foods and less processed junk, that‚Äôs going to benefit anyone,‚Äù she says.Be mindful about eating habits, and prioritize what works for you. Above all, be kind to yourself, Cowan says. ‚ÄúPeople beat themselves up about what they eat or don‚Äôt eat, and that‚Äôs not healthy.‚Äù"
157.0,"The Bay Area‚Äôs cocktail culture is now mature enough to warrant a history lesson ‚Äî and its major players are intertwined enough to warrant a genealogy lesson.Looking at the last 25 years, this strong bartending community has allowed the Bay Area cocktail scene to flourish, creating just one or two degrees of separation between the region‚Äôs important bars, and allowing the culture to evolve at an impressively rapid speed.That continuity of bars and bartenders often tempts people to ascribe a single, distinctive style to the Bay Area cocktail. But the diversity of our scene eludes definition. Our style is often reduced to its reliance on local produce, and while that regionalism is certainly an aspect of our bar scene, it‚Äôs not the whole picture. The Bay Area is equally rooted in a rigorous study of the classics, and our drinks style, if we have one, depends just as much on that meticulous methodology as on innovation.A better question: What are this history‚Äôs major inflection points? When, for instance, did we start caring about the quality and provenance of our spirits? When did serious drinks become a requirement for fine dining restaurants? When did stand-alone bars become destinations? When did tiki get upgraded to craft-cocktail standards? When did our city‚Äôs bartenders become local celebrities?To answer these questions, we have to go back to 1992. Muddle, muddle,toil and trouble Before it could kick off the modern cocktail revolution, San Francisco had to relearn the classics. That began with Enrico‚Äôs, which opened (for the second time) in 1992. For this incarnation, its opening bartender was Paul Harrington, who had previously worked at the Townhouse in Emeryville. Harrington reintroduced San Francisco to classic cocktails like the Aviation, the Hemingway Daiquiri and, most importantly, the mojito. The explosive popularity of the latter at Enrico‚Äôs led to seasonal variations of the drink, muddled with local fruit.In subsequent years, this approach, driven by muddlers and produce, was often incorrectly assumed to be the Bay Area style, a generalization that ignores the classic cocktail roots that took hold. Who else had an Aviation on the menu at the time?Enrico‚Äôs became a hub for all of its era‚Äôs aspiring bartenders, including a Portland, Ore., transplant named Marcovaldo Dionysos, who arrived with an arsenal of old classic cocktail books.Later, when Dionysos helped open Absinthe in 1998, he rode the Encrico‚Äôs momentum, creating a menu of wildly popular gin cocktails ‚Äî notable for a decade when vodka was king. Retro libations and modern classics, like the Ginger Rogers, continue to fill the Absinthe bar today.Both Enrico‚Äôs and Absinthe spawned other ambitious bar programs, including Clock Bar, where Dionysos later worked. Jonny Raglin got his chops at Absinthe, then went on to found other Absinthe Group bars, including Comstock Saloon, co-launched with Jeff Hollinger. Raglin would also establish the bars at Dosa and Nopa, and Hollinger would write the influential book ‚ÄúThe Art of the Bar.‚Äù The farm-to-table influence: Sourcing¬†and ingredients Using local produce was one thing. Responsibly sourcing and putting care into basic ingredients like spirits, ice and sweeteners was another, and Thad Vogler‚Äôs early years at the Slanted Door were critical in defining that. Vogler scrutinized the provenance of spirits like no one had before, pulling many popular big-name brands off the shelf because he found them to be poor quality. Approaching spirits like wine, he traveled worldwide to visit spirits producers, cementing his conviction ‚Äî expressed in his recent book, ‚ÄúBy the Smoke and the Smell‚Äù ‚Äî to use products from grower-producers. That conviction continues to define the style at his own bars, Bar Agricole and Trou Normand, as well as other bars he helped build, including Camino, Jardiniere and Beretta.It was also at Slanted Door that bartender Jennifer Colliau began exploring higher-quality sweeteners. Instead of relying on the standard liqueurs and mixers based on high-fructose corn syrup, Colliau created her own syrups. In 2008, she would go on to launch these syrups commercially, under her Small Hands Foods label, a brand that has become common behind local bars.Erik Adkins, current bar director for the Slanted Door Group, who took over when Vogler left, was significant in spreading this gospel by fostering a new generation of influential bartenders at (now-closed) sister bars like Heaven‚Äôs Dog, Coachman and Wo Hing.Meanwhile, in the East Bay, Berkeley‚Äôs C√©sar took a cue from the farm-to-table food movement that was born at Chez Panisse next door. Founded in 1998 by Chez alum Richard Mazzera, the groundbreaking bar compiled a massive collection of Sherry, eau de vie and innovative drinks, creating a perpetually packed bar and training ground for bartenders like Jessica Maria (Hotsy Totsy), Dylan O‚ÄôBrien (Prizefighter) and Scott Baird (Trick Dog).But perhaps no one put a bigger emphasis on sourcing high-quality spirits than Julio Bermejo. For decades, the margaritas at the Bermejo family's Outer Richmond restaurant, Tommy's Mexican, were made with mixto Tequila, an agave spirit blended with corn, wheat and artificial ingredients. When Julio Bermejo discovered Herradura Tequila, made from 100 percent agave, it sparked a revolution. Though his quest began in 1989, it took Bermejo years to stock a full bar of good Tequila ‚Äî and even longer to spread the Tequila gospel. (Eventually, in 2001, he earned the title of U.S. Tequila ambassador.)The famous Tommy‚Äôs Margarita transformed the expectations of what Tequila should be in practically every Bay Area bar, and it also paved the way for future bars that would be driven by a single-spirit focus: Smuggler‚Äôs Cove (rum), Rickhouse (whiskey), Lol√≥ (agave-based spirits), Whitechapel (gin). Food & beverage synergy By the time Range opened in 2005, the modern cocktail movement was exploding in the Bay Area, and a tightly defined community was forming. Range became one of the most popular places in San Francisco to get a drink ‚Äî and a job. An all-star cast of bartenders at Range, including Brooke Arthur, Carlos Yturria (now co-owner of the Treasury) and Dominic Venegas were the backbone of the Bay Area‚Äôs growing cocktail community.At the same time, chef Phil West‚Äôs kitchen spilled over to the bar with a daily cocktail special that challenged the bartenders to think as dynamically as the chef did.But cocktails still hadn‚Äôt graduated to the fine dining stage they occupy today until Cyrus came along in 2005. When the Healdsburg restaurant opened, bartender Scott Beattie introduced his unique brand of meticulous, foraged-ingredient and visually impressive cocktails to the wine drinking counties.Beattie‚Äôs work, revolutionary for its time, created the expectation that all fine dining restaurants should incorporate cocktails as a holistic experience. Of the seven Bay Area restaurants that currently hold a perfect three Michelin stars, all but two offer cocktails or spirits designed to match the experience of the food. Era of the dedicated cocktail bar begins Until the critical year of 2006, all of the Bay Area‚Äôs craft cocktail programs had opened in restaurants. That changed with Cantina and Bourbon & Branch.The Tenderloin‚Äôs Bourbon & Branch gave the Bay Area its first speakeasy and Prohibition-inspired cocktail service, but its opening was equally newsworthy for its bartending staff, an Avengers-style collection of talent that included Dionysos, Venegas, Jon Santer (Prizefighter) and Neyah White (Nopa). Its operating group, Future Bars, would go on to open some of the biggest bars in town: Local Edition, Rickhouse, Tradition, Pagan Idol and Ginger‚Äôs, among others.Bourbon & Branch began to transform the perception of what standalone, neighborhood bars could be, making them destinations for a night on the town despite not being a club or having a kitchen. That continues to be true today at places like Rye, Brass Tacks and Third Rail.It was also in 2006 that tiki ‚Äî a genre for which the Bay Area has always had a fondness ‚Äî took a turn for the (more) serious and came into the modern era, with the opening of Forbidden Island in Alameda. The assumption had long been that complicated 10-ingredient tiki recipes were impossible to build into a business using craft cocktail ingredients, but at Forbidden Island, Martin Cate changed that.Its success lit a fire under the feet of classic tiki establishments, like Tonga Room and Trader Vic‚Äôs, to up their cocktail game. And it made possible today‚Äôs highbrow tiki bars like Pagan Idol, Jungle Bird in Sacramento and, of course, Cate‚Äôs own Smuggler‚Äôs Cove. The ubiquity of¬†the craft cocktail With the opening of Beretta in 2008, craft cocktails arrived in the down-market restaurant, demonstrating that even casual, high-volume weeknight spots could serve well-made cocktails using quality ingredients. Bar manager Thad Vogler used a different unrefined sweetener (in many cases, Small Hands Foods syrups) in every drink on the opening menu. The original bar staff included the entire opening crew from Bourbon & Branch. The house was packed every night, despite the fact that there were no big brands available and no cranberry juice. All in a pizzeria in the Mission.Beretta‚Äôs combination of casual food and great cocktails brought the bottom way up, establishing the expectation for well-made cocktails anywhere there is a bar. Places like Ramen Shop, the Saratoga and Maven continue the tradition.These days, other forces continue to carve the landscape of Bay Area cocktails. The high cost of doing business here is not only driving up cocktail prices, it‚Äôs creating a reality in which bars need to churn out large volumes to stay in business ‚Äî making small, intimate bars extremely difficult to open and endangering dive bars.Still, a new generation is evolving the styles and trends of the bars that came before. This year‚Äôs Bar Stars work at a few of them ‚Äî Pagan Idol, the Sea Star, 54 Mint, Dirty Habit and, once again, Beretta ‚Äî and there are plenty more.Wildhawk , for example, is a powerhouse of female bartenders mixing up potent classics and innovative drinks, while Pacific Cocktail Haven (PCH) is flawlessly blending unusual ingredients like snap peas. Benjamin Cooper makes the weird accessible but is also adept at customized, tailor-made drinks. Miminashi and Duke‚Äôs Spirited Cocktails are giving Wine Country reasons to drink more than just wine, and ABV is helping to redefine the drinking experience with its Over Proof pop-ups. Prizefighter continues to redefine the neighborhood bar while championing consistency and bartending techniques ‚Äî basics many bars have neglected in the quest to over-innovate.What will bartending here look like in another 25 years?"
6.0,"More than 250,000 San Francisco homes and businesses are about to become customers of CleanPowerSF, the municipal electricity program operated by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.In preparation for what will be the largest enrollment effort in the program‚Äôs history, the SFPUC began notifying residents and merchants this week that, by the spring, they‚Äôll be receiving city-sourced electricity.The SFPUC has been automatically switching portions of the city into CleanPowerSF since 2016, and the agency has about 111,000 customers. In the coming months, the SFPUC expects to more than triple that number, with a projected enrollment of 360,000 dwellings by the end of April. Just over 3 percent of customers opt out of the program, according to the SFPUC, electing to keep Pacific Gas & Electric Co. as their power provider.Combined with the SFPUC‚Äôs Hetch Hetchy Power program, which uses greenhouse-gas-free energy primarily to power Muni vehicles and all the city-owned government buildings, the agency will be serving roughly 80 percent of San Francisco‚Äôs electricity demand by the end of April.‚ÄúThis is a big deal,‚Äù said Barbara Hale, SFPUC assistant general manager in charge of power. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in every neighborhood, every block of the city, serving CleanPowerSF power.‚ÄùIn the coming months, CleanPowerSF‚Äôs expansion will overlap with deliberations that could shape the direction of the city‚Äôs energy future.After PG&E‚Äôs bankruptcy seemed inevitable because of liabilities related to wildfires, Mayor London Breed instructed the SFPUC to start planning the city‚Äôs response to the utility‚Äôs insolvency and ensure that electricity flowed uninterrupted. One major part of that was determining whether the city could afford to buy PG&E‚Äôs infrastructure, which would allow San Francisco to have greater control over its energy needs.‚ÄúThe success of our CleanPowerSF program shows the city knows how to deliver renewable energy for San Franciscans, and acquiring more assets to deliver that clean energy is a priority,‚Äù Breed said. ‚ÄúIf there is an opportunity, we will take it.‚ÄùWhile CleanPowerSF procures the electricity, the program still relies on PG&E to distribute it, handle billing and address outages.Hale said the SFPUC is crunching the numbers on whether it makes financial sense over the long-term to buy PG&E‚Äôs equipment ‚Äî like underground transformers, and transmission lines and substations ‚Äî and take over billing customers. The agency is also considering what kind of workforce it might need to hire if it became a fully independent electrical utility.‚ÄúWe think about it as scaling up the services we already provide,‚Äù Hale said. ‚ÄúThe meta-question we‚Äôre asking ourselves is: Can we provide reliable, safe, affordable electricity services ... and meet our financial metrics?‚ÄùSan Franciscans pay an estimated $300 million annually for electricity services like transmission and distribution. That‚Äôs money that, if the SFPUC became fully independent, the city could invest in improving and building out its electrical system and toward meeting its clean-energy goals.In addition to determining how much of the utility‚Äôs assets it could acquire, the SFPUC is also putting a price tag on repair and upkeep costs, as well as the costs of physically separating the assets it buys from the rest of PG&E‚Äôs distribution network.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a giant math equation,‚Äù Hale said.Acquiring assets from PG&E would likely cost billions of dollars. But San Francisco voters approved a potential funding source in June when they passed Proposition A, a measure that allows the SFPUC to sell bonds to pay for clean-energy infrastructure, with the approval of the Board of Supervisors. Several board members, including Supervisors Hillary Ronen and Sandra Lee Fewer, have expressed interest in exploring what Ronen has called a ‚Äúcomplete divorce‚Äù from PG&E.For the SFPUC, fleshing out its role as an electrical utility provider would also mean maintaining infrastructure it wasn‚Äôt previously responsible for, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economics professor who directs the university‚Äôs Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. The city would also likely be responsible for responding to power outages and other customer-service tasks it currently doesn‚Äôt address.‚ÄúYou would literally have to hire trucks, workers, all of that, to be responsive when there are outages or repairs that have to be done ‚Äî everything,‚Äù Wolak said. ‚ÄúMore likely what would happen is ... the city would contract with PG&E to do those sorts of things.‚ÄùAnd just because the city might be prepared to buy the assets doesn‚Äôt mean PG&E will be ready to sell. Much of PG&E‚Äôs financial future is now in the hands of the bankruptcy court, which makes it hard to say whether the company would be in a position to shed assets.‚ÄúPG&E regularly evaluates the way the company is structured ‚Äî strategically, operationally and financially ‚Äî so that we are best positioned to operate efficiently and to provide safe and reliable service to our customers,‚Äù a PG&E spokesman said in an email.Hale said the utility has signaled a willingness to hear offers, ‚Äúand I think it‚Äôs fair to say that if SFPUC brings a credible offer to PG&E and their shareholders and their board, they‚Äôll give it careful consideration.‚Äù"
22.0,"NEW DELHI (AP) ‚Äî With India's national elections barely months away, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under heavy pressure from his supporters to punish archrival Pakistan for a suicide attack on an Indian paramilitary convoy that killed at least 41 soldiers in disputed Kashmir.India placed the blame for Thursday's bombing squarely on neighboring Pakistan, which India accuses of supporting rebels in Kashmir, a charge that Islamabad denies. A look at some of the retaliatory steps India is likely to consider:___DIPLOMATIC ISOLATIONIndia's first public reaction to the attack was to withdraw the most-favored nation trade status given to Pakistan and take all possible diplomatic steps ""to ensure the complete isolation from international community of Pakistan."" New Delhi insists ""incontrovertible evidence is available of (Pakistan) having a direct hand in this gruesome terrorist incident.""The Greater Kashmir newspaper reported that the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, headquartered in Pakistan, claimed responsibility. India's foreign ministry on Friday briefed New Delhi-based diplomats from key countries, including China, which has in the past blocked India's proposal to list Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a designated terrorist by the United Nations. The ministry demanded Pakistan take ""immediate and verifiable action against terrorists and terror groups operating from territories under its control to create conducive atmosphere in the region free of terror.""___MILITARY STRIKESAfter a 2016 attack on an Indian army base that killed 19 soldiers, India's army said it carried out a campaign of ""surgical strikes"" against militants across the highly militarized frontier that divides the Kashmir region between India and Pakistan. Pakistan dismissed the reports that India's military had targeted ""terrorist launch pads"" inside the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. Islamabad said instead that two of its soldiers were killed in ""unprovoked"" firing by India across the border.Following the latest attack ‚Äî the worst attack against Indian government forces in Kashmir's history ‚Äî Modi warned that those behind it would pay a heavy price and that security forces have been given a free hand to act against terror. The Times of India newspaper reported Saturday that the military options ‚Äî short of two nuclear-armed rivals going to war ‚Äî could range from ""shallow ground-based attacks and occupation of some heights along the Line of Control (cease-fire line) to restricted but precision airstrikes against non-state targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.""G. Parthasarthy, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan, said a possible military response can't be discussed in public. ""We have said that Pakistan will pay a price,"" he said. ""For obvious reasons we are not going to spell out how that cost would be imposed.""Paul Staniland, a political science professor and South Asia expert at the University of Chicago, said Pakistan's army is assuming it will be attacked and that Indian forces are preparing for a serious incursion of some sort.___DOMESTIC PRESSUREIndian analysts say no political party can afford to neglect public opinion ahead of India's election. Already, protesters chanted ""Attack Pakistan"" and fiery debates on television channels demanded retaliation.""I think the situation is extremely tense,"" said Amitabh Mattoo, professor of international studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. ""The mood in the country is extremely angry at what has happened. And moreover, there are elections in the offing. No party could afford to neglect public opinion.""Staniland said the stakes are too high for India to do nothing at all. ""Modi is in a tricky position,"" he said. ""Indian forces are quite capable, but it's not obvious what kinds of strikes would accomplish the core goal. Kashmir and Pakistan are among the few foreign policy topics that have real electoral resonance.""Elections are scheduled to be held before May.___U.S. RESPONSEThe U.S. singled out Pakistan in a statement condemning the attack and said it had strengthened U.S. resolve to bolster counterterrorism cooperation with India. To improve India's military capabilities, the U.S. has offered to sell it unarmed Guardian surveillance drones, aircraft carrier technologies and F-18 and F-16 fighter aircraft. There are sticking points, however, including the purchase by India of Iranian oil and the Russian S-400 ground-to-air missile system, which could trigger U.S. sanctions on India.___THE HIMALAYAN PUZZLEIndian-controlled Kashmir has remained a challenge for India's policymakers ever since the Himalayan territory was split between India and Pakistan shortly after the two archrivals gained independence in 1947. The territory has been at the heart of India's two wars out of four the country fought against Pakistan and China. Human rights groups say India has been responding to public protest with disproportionate force while treating the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination as Islamabad's proxy war against New Delhi.New Delhi initially grappled with largely peaceful anti-India protests. However, a series of political blunders, broken promises and a crackdown on dissent led to Kashmir's eruption into a full-blown armed rebellion against India in 1989 for a united Kashmir, either under Pakistani rule or independent of both countries. Indian forces largely crushed the rebellion in the mid-2000s. But the conflict intensified after Modi came to power in 2014 amid rising attacks by Hindu hard-liners against minorities in India, further deepening frustration with New Delhi's rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir.Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has toughened its stance both against Pakistan and Kashmiri separatists. Policy experts say such an approach is intended to project the party as strong and uncompromising. But Modi's policies have also had the unintended consequence of strengthening the resolve of those fighting for an end to India's rule in Kashmir.___THE VIEW FROM PAKISTANAfter Imran Khan took over as Pakistan's prime minister last August, he promised to take two steps forward for India's one step to forge friendly ties. He said Kashmir was at the core of their differences, and that the countries have to end the tit-for-tat accusations. But the peace initiative remained a nonstarter, with violence rising in the Indian portion of Kashmir and India asking Pakistan to stop supporting insurgents.Khan has now proposed to hold talks with India after the Indian elections. The former cricketer is very popular in India. He recently offered to open a Sikh religious shrine for Indian visitors on the Pakistani side of the border in Punjab province as a peace gesture. But in September, India pulled the plug on a rare meeting between its foreign minister and her Pakistani counterpart on the sidelines of a U.N. summit ‚Äî a move that was termed ""arrogant"" by Khan and unleashed a barrage of insults from both sides. India says it has not seen any constructive approach from Pakistan.___"
28.0,"It has become a political guessing game from California to Washington, D.C.: What exactly Gov. Gavin Newsom meant when he said California‚Äôs high-speed-rail project, ‚Äúas currently planned, would cost too much and take too long.‚ÄùWas the new governor killing all but a 165-mile stretch of high-speed rail in the Central Valley ‚Äî or was he reimagining the full bullet-train project in a more realistic way?Newsom said that ‚Äúright now, there simply isn‚Äôt a path‚Äù to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles, as the plan was pitched to voters in 2008. But, the governor said in his State of the State speech Tuesday, ‚Äúwe do have the capacity to complete a high-speed-rail link between Merced and Bakersfield.‚ÄùWhat people heard depended on their feelings about the California project ‚Äî and, in many cases, their party affiliation.At the head of the line was President Trump, who wasn‚Äôt buying Newsom‚Äôs contention that high-speed rail is a dream deferred. Instead, he said the governor had killed it and he told the state to return $3.5 billion in federal funding that it must surrender if a first leg of the project isn‚Äôt finished by 2022.‚ÄúCalifornia has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars,‚Äù Trump tweeted Wednesday night. ‚ÄúThey owe the Federal Government three and a half billion dollars. We want that money back now. Whole project is a ‚Äògreen‚Äô disaster!‚ÄùCalifornia has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars. They owe the Federal Government three and a half billion dollars. We want that money back now. Whole project is a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù disaster!Newsom replied with his own tweet that Trump‚Äôs take was ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and added, ‚ÄúThis is CA‚Äôs money, allocated by Congress for this project. We‚Äôre not giving it back.‚ÄùFake news. We‚Äôre building high-speed rail, connecting the Central Valley and beyond.This is CA‚Äôs money, allocated by Congress for this project. We‚Äôre not giving it back.The train is leaving the station ‚Äî better get on board! (Also, desperately searching for some wall $$??) https://t.co/9hxEfEX8VmHowever, Trump wasn‚Äôt the only one who interpreted the speech that way. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ‚Äî a Republican who represents Bakersfield and has long opposed the project ‚Äî tweeted congratulations after the governor‚Äôs address: ‚ÄúThe train to nowhere is finally stopped. This is the right move by Gavin Newsom.‚ÄùThe train to nowhere is finally stopped. This is the right move by @GavinNewsom. #CAHSRI look forward to working w/ Governor Newsom and federal officials in the coming weeks to best mitigate what has already been wasted on high-speed rail due to the previous Administration.That‚Äôs not what state Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, heard the governor say.‚ÄúWhat I heard (Newsom) say is not that high-speed rail is off,‚Äù Wiener said. ‚ÄúWhat he‚Äôs saying is that, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs focus on the phase that‚Äôs under construction, that we have the funding for. Then we‚Äôll work on extending it.‚Äô ‚ÄùSan Francisco Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat who leads the Budget Committee, agreed.‚ÄúWhat he said was that he was going to accelerate the project,‚Äù Ting said on The Chronicle‚Äôs ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs All Political‚Äù podcast.Brian Kelly, the California High Speed Rail Authority CEO, took Newsom‚Äôs remarks to mean that he ‚Äúreaffirmed our commitment to complete the environmental work statewide‚Äù on the rail project and ‚Äúmeet our ‚Äòbookend‚Äô investments in the Bay Area and Los Angeles.‚ÄùKelly‚Äôs comments confused Bakersfield Assemblyman Vince Fong, a Republican whose district includes the proposed route. He opposes the project.It sounded to Fong like Newsom was trying to have it both ways ‚Äî appear to high-speed rail skeptics that he was killing a boondoggle, and to the project‚Äôs fans that there is a way forward despite cost estimates that have more than doubled to $77 billion.Those fans tend to include the Democratic Party‚Äôs most progressive wing. The ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù federal package of carbon-cutting suggestions from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and allies includes a big dose of high-speed rail.‚ÄúIs this the beginning, and he‚Äôs building out the Central Valley portion first? Or is this it?‚Äù Fong asked.‚ÄúBecause if high-speed rail is now a line that runs from Merced to Bakersfield, it‚Äôs no longer high-speed rail. It is fundamentally different than what was told to voters,‚Äù Fong said.In 2008, 53 percent of California voters approved issuing nearly $10 billion in general obligation bonds to build a rail line from San Francisco to Los Angeles.If that version of high-speed rail isn‚Äôt happening, Fong wants to halt the project ‚Äî even though it is under construction in the Central Valley ‚Äî and ‚Äúbring it back to voters to revote on this new project.‚ÄùMcCarthy doubts that a line going from Bakersfield to Merced would have the ridership to survive without taxpayer subsidies.‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said we shouldn‚Äôt have put the taxpayers‚Äô money into this,‚Äù McCarthy said Wednesday. ‚ÄúI know the (Green New Deal) said we should have high-speed rail, but now we have Gov. Gavin Newsom saying it doesn‚Äôt work.‚ÄùBut Newsom did not say that high-speed rail doesn‚Äôt work. He said there isn‚Äôt the money now to complete the original project.‚ÄúThe governor supports a statewide high-speed-rail system, as the voters approved,‚Äù said Kelly, the High Speed Rail Authority CEO. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs acknowledging we don‚Äôt have full funding for that now, so he‚Äôs saying, get trains on the ground where we can while we ready the rest of the state for the project and pursue more funding. Deliver and expand.‚ÄùNewsom spokesman Nathan Click said the governor  ‚Äúhas not given up on the broader vision of the project‚Äù of bullet trains from San Francisco to Los Angeles.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about reprioritizing and refocusing,‚Äù Click said. ‚ÄúThe reality is that the money has been identified already for that portion of the project‚Äù in the Central Valley.Once that portion of the line is up and running, Click said, there is a greater chance that more federal dollars and possibly private investment could surface.But for now, Newsom will ask the Legislature to extend a March 1 deadline that the state rail authority had to present an update on its progress. The authority expects to reveal its revised plan for a Central Valley focus later this year.Newsom faced a tough decision about what to do about high-speed rail. The state has already sunk billions into it, and construction is under way. But a state auditor‚Äôs report last fall said costs had ballooned because of bad decision-making, and warned that the state risked losing crucial federal funding if it couldn‚Äôt speed up construction.Plus, voters have become indifferent. Only 19 percent of likely voters surveyed in December said building a bullet-train line was a high priority, according to a nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California poll.Newsom aides realized belatedly that his State of the State remarks had caused confusion. They sent out a memo of talking points to supporters afterward emphasizing that Newsom wants to complete the project ‚Äî someday.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to make high speed rail a reality in California,‚Äù Newsom tweeted Tuesday afternoon as headlines about the death of high-speed rail started popping up online.We're going to make high-speed rail a reality for CA. We have the capacity to complete the rail between Merced and Bakersfield. We will continue our regional projects north and south. Finish Phase 1 enviro work. Connect the Central Valley to other parts of the state.But even then, Newsom wasn‚Äôt clear about the future.‚ÄúWe will continue our regional projects north and south. Finish Phase 1 enviro work,‚Äù he tweeted. But that was a wonky reference to studies for the Bay Area and Los Angeles portions of the line that only the most fervent of high-speed-rail aficionados would get.In his speech to lawmakers, Newsom began his high-speed- rail remarks by saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be real.‚Äù A day later, ‚Äúreal‚Äù was still in the eye of the beholder.Joe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs senior political writer.

34.0,"AURORA, Ill. (AP) ‚Äî The frantic calls started pouring in at 1:24 p.m. A gunman was shooting people inside a sprawling manufacturing warehouse in Aurora, Illinois.Within four minutes, the first police officers rushed to the 29,000-square-foot building in the suburban Chicago city and were fired on immediately; one was struck outside and four others shot inside.By the time the chaos ended Friday afternoon, five male employees of Henry Pratt Co. were found dead and the gunman was killed in a shootout with police after a 90-minute search of the sprawling warehouse. Five male police officers were hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening.""For so many years, we have seen similar situations throughout our nation and the horrible feeling that we get when we see it on the news. To experience it first-hand, is even more painful,"" said Aurora Mayor Richard C. Irvin.Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said the gunman, 45-year-old Gary Martin, was being fired from his job Friday after 15 years with the company. It was not immediately known why Martin was being fired.""We don't know whether he had the gun on him at the time or if he went to retrieve it,"" Ziman said.She also said that authorities don't yet know if the employees firing him were among the victims. The names of those killed were not immediately released.In addition to the five employees killed, a sixth worker was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. A sixth police officer suffered a knee injury while officers were searching the building.The shooting shocked the city of 200,000 that is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago.Christy Fonseca often worries about some of the gang-related crimes and shootings around her mother's Aurora neighborhood. But she never expected the type of phone call she got from her mom on Friday, warning her to be careful with an active shooter loose in the town.Police cars with screaming sirens revved past her as she drove to her mother's house, where the Henry Pratt building is visible from the porch stoop. It was only when they flipped on the television news that they realized Martin had killed people just a few hundred feet away.""In Aurora, period, we'd never thought anything like this would happen,"" Fonseca, a lifelong resident, said as she looked out at the warehouse where Henry Pratt makes valves for industrial purposes.At Acorn Woods Condominiums where Martin lived, a mix of brick apartments and condos nestled on a quiet street just a mile and a half from the shooting, neighbors gathered on sidewalks near Martin's unit talking and wondering among themselves if they knew or had come in contact with him.Mary McKnight stepped out of her car with a cherry cheesecake purchased for her son's birthday, to find a flurry of police cars, officers and media trucks.""This is a strange thing to come home to, right,"" she said. She had just learned that the shooter lived close by and his unit in the complex had been taped off by police.Asked if Martin's rampage had been a ""classic"" workplace shooting, police chief Ziman said:""I don't know. We can only surmise with a gentleman that's being terminated that this was something he intended to do."""
36.0,"President Trump‚Äôs declaration of a national emergency at the southern border Friday claimed another casualty in his war on the law and language. Under every accepted definition and precedent, his so-called emergency is not one.Rather, it‚Äôs a brazen attempt to violate the Constitution‚Äôs basic restraints on presidential power to compensate for the limitations of his policies and politics. Having diminished the already weak support for his border wall with the longest government shutdown on record, Trump vowed to use emergency and other powers to redirect more than $6 billion to the project. That‚Äôs nearly five times what Congress eventually approved for additional border fencing this week in the bill Trump reluctantly signed.Even as the president thereby dropped the threat of another pointless shutdown, his emergency declaration leveled a direct assault on Congress‚Äô spending authority. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others rightly promised to oppose the maneuver, which drew criticism from several Republican senators. Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans were all too ready to accommodate Trump.The National Emergencies Act allows Pelosi‚Äôs House Democrats to challenge the declaration and trigger a mandatory Senate vote. It would be a rare case in which McConnell could not block a floor vote, forcing his Senate Republicans to say yea or nay to a directive that pits their fear of Trump against their avowed constitutionalism. A majority vote against the emergency could be vetoed by Trump, however, and an override would require many more Republican defections.The emergency declaration has fiscal as well as constitutional implications. While the administration appears to have abandoned the controversial prospect of redirecting funds for flood control in California and other places, it‚Äôs now eyeing money for an array of military construction projects that are sure to have their backers in Congress.The declaration is also bound to be disputed in court, with Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra among the eager plaintiffs.Every invocation of the National Emergencies Act since it became law has targeted hostile foreign governments or groups or responded to clear domestic crises such as the 2009 flu pandemic and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Trump‚Äôs own extensive deliberations over whether to declare this emergency offer one indication that it‚Äôs disingenuous. Trump even acknowledged that he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt need to do this.‚ÄùThe border ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù Trump proposes to stop with his emergent wall simply isn‚Äôt occurring. Illegal crossings have fallen to about a fourth of their peak during George W. Bush‚Äôs administration, and there‚Äôs no evidence of Trump‚Äôs claims that more fortification will substantially thwart drug smuggling, human trafficking, crime or terrorism. Despite the president‚Äôs harping on the threat of those surreptitiously crossing unsecured stretches of the border, the recent uptick in immigration from Mexico has consisted mainly of Central American families seeking asylum under U.S. and international law.With the nation recognizing a holiday set aside for its greatest presidents, Trump‚Äôs fake emergency evokes tin-pot autocracy and marks another low for his presidency."
37.0,"LOS ANGELES (AP) ‚Äî A federal judge on Friday permanently blocked the Trump administration from imposing conditions that police departments cooperate with immigration authorities to receive law enforcement grants.The Department of Justice exceeded its authority and violated the constitution by requiring grant recipients to allow immigration authorities into jails and provide advance notice before releasing detainees suspected of being in the country illegally, Judge Manuel Real said.Real said he agreed with a related ruling from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago that said: ""The attorney general in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement. But the power of the purse rests with Congress, which authorized the federal funds at issue and did not impose any immigration enforcement conditions on the receipt of such funds.""As a sanctuary city, Los Angeles does not provide the cooperation required by the grants.City Attorney Mike Feuer sought the permanent injunction in a lawsuit after LA didn't receive Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants in 2017 for the first time in 20 years. The city had received more than $1 million each year from the grant that goes toward hiring, equipment, training and other needs.""We've got to stand up for public safety in Los Angeles and against the Trump administration's efforts to arrogate to itself authority it does not have,"" Feuer said in a statement. ""No matter who holds the presidency, the constitution is still the supreme law of land.""A Justice Department spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The ruling applies nationwide and includes another grant program aimed at fighting juvenile gang crime.In a similar case, Real ruled in the city's favor in April over a grant program for hiring police officers.The grant rules were imposed by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said cities endangered public safety if they didn't help enforce immigration laws.Los Angeles is one of many U.S. cities that have implemented sanctuary laws aimed at focusing law enforcement officers on local crime rather than detaining people suspected of being in the country illegally.___"
38.0,"WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Defiant in the wake of a stinging budget defeat, President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, moving to secure more money for his long-promised wall by exercising a broad interpretation of his presidential powers that is certain to draw stiff legal challenges.In his emergency proclamation Friday, Trump painted a dark picture of the border as ""a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics"" and one that threatens ""core national security interests."" Overall, though, illegal border crossings are down from a high of 1.6 million in 2000.His declaration instantly transformed a contentious policy fight into a foundational dispute over the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution, spurring talk of a congressional vote to block Trump and ensuring that the president and Democrats will continue fighting over the border wall in Congress, the courts and on the campaign trail.It triggered outrage from Democrats, unease among some Republicans and flew in the face of years of GOP complaints that President Barack Obama had over-reached in his use of executive authority.Trump signed the declaration to justify diverting billions of federal dollars from military construction and other purposes after Congress approved only a fraction of the money he had demanded. The standoff over border funding had led to the longest government shutdown in history. To avoid another shutdown, Trump reluctantly signed a funding bill Friday that included just $1.4 billion of the $5.7 billion he had demanded for the wall.Trump announced the declaration in a free-wheeling, 50-minute Rose Garden news conference that included a long preamble about his administration's accomplishments. He jousted with reporters and delivered a sing-song prediction about the fate of the order as it winds its way through the legal system before potentially ending up at the Supreme Court.""Sadly, we'll be sued and sadly it will go through a process and happily we'll win, I think,"" said Trump.Within hours of Trump's statement, the American Civil Liberties Union announced it would file suit challenging his emergency powers declaration.""By the president's very own admission in the Rose Garden, there is no national emergency. He just grew impatient and frustrated with Congress, and decided to move along his promise for a border wall 'faster,'"" said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero.  Some Democratic state attorneys general have also threatened to go to court over the decision.The text of Trump's proclamation cited an increase in families coming across the border and an inability to detain families during deportation proceedings ‚Äî not drugs or violence as the president outlined in his press conference. The top two Democrats in Congress said they'd use ""every remedy available"" to oppose what they cast as an unlawful measure.""The President's actions clearly violate the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said in a joint statement.Trump defended his use of an emergency declaration, saying other presidents had done the same. Other presidents have used emergency powers, but not to pay for projects that Congress wouldn't support.And Trump himself sent mixed messages as to its necessity. He wrote in the official proclamation that ""Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis.""But he seemed to tip his hand at a political motive when he said during the news conference, ""I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster,"" an admission certain to be cited during legal challenges.Republicans had opposed Trump declaring a national emergency, repeatedly warning that it would set a bad precedent and divide the party when Democrats put it up for a vote. While many in the GOP on Friday fell in line behind Trump's decision, others remain opposed.""I don't believe a national emergency declaration is the solution,"" Sen Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in a statement. ""It wouldn't provide enough funding to adequately secure our borders, it would likely get tied up in litigation, and most concerning is that it would create a new precedent that a left-wing president would undoubtedly utilize to implement their radical policy agenda while bypassing the authority of Congress.""House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler called for a hearing on the ""serious constitutional and statutory issues"" the declaration raises,Congressional votes in coming weeks on a resolution blocking the emergency declaration were highly likely, but the timing was uncertain. Once a resolution is introduced, leaders by law cannot prevent votes on such a measure, which would need a simple majority to pass each chamber.A resolution would all but certainly pass the Democratic-controlled House and may also pass the Republican-run Senate, if a few GOP senators break with Trump.  Congress seemed unlikely to muster the two-thirds majorities needed in each chamber to override a certain Trump veto. But forcing him to cast his first veto on the issue would underscore internal divisions GOP leaders would rather avoid highlighting.The money in the spending bill Trump signed would finance just a quarter of the more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) of barrier he wanted this year.To bridge the gap, Trump announced that he will be spending roughly $8 billion on border barriers ‚Äî combining the money approved by Congress with funding he plans to repurpose through executive actions, including the national emergency. Money for hundreds of military construction projects around the country was potentially targeted, and Democratic congressional aides were wary that projects sponsored by Democratic lawmakers might be disproportionately hit.For all of Trump's talk of a crisis, illegal border crossings are down from a high of 1.6 million in 2000, but those were mostly single men from Mexico. What's on the rise now is the number of Central American families who come to claim asylum and can't be easily returned to their countries. Some 50,000 families are crossing the border illegally each month ‚Äî straining the U.S. asylum system and border facilities, which are not set up to manage the crush.A number of Trump's potential 2020 challengers condemned the national emergency, including Sen.

42.0,"The slowdown in new market-rate, residential development is starting to take its toll on San Francisco‚Äôs affordable housing pipeline, as rising construction costs and a softening market are resulting in less money flowing to the city programs that support affordable projects.The amount of fees that market-rate housing and office developers pay into the city‚Äôs affordable housing fund has plummeted 70 percent from the high in fiscal year 2015-16, declining from $111 million to $35 million in the current fiscal year.Kate Hartley, director of the Mayor‚Äôs Office of Housing and Community Development, said the decline isn‚Äôt surprising, as market-rate developers have become more cautious about breaking ground on new buildings.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty well documented that the market-rate development has slowed,‚Äù Hartley said.The Bay Area is suffering from an acute lack of housing, which is driving up prices and forcing many people out of the market ‚Äî and out of the region. As we cover this issue, The Chronicle will aim to examine the roots of the shortage, how our communities are dealing with it, and what solutions might be possible.While the slowdown doesn‚Äôt impact the current crop of affordable housing projects ‚Äî money has already been set aside for projects that are approved and being started this year ‚Äî it could delay developments in the design and review stages.Fernando Marti, executive director of Council of Community Housing Organizations, which advocates for affordable housing, said the city has postponed issuing request for proposals for several new projects, namely 180 Jones St., slated for about 60 units, and the site above new Central Subway station at Fourth and Folsom streets, set for about 75 units.‚ÄúThere are a few projects that are a little iffy as far as where the money is going to come from,‚Äù said Marti. ‚ÄúThese are projects that we expected the city to put out (requests for proposals) on, now they are telling us to wait a little bit.‚ÄùDown the road, delays in other market-rate projects could hurt more affordable developments, said Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corp. Executive Director Don Falk.In particular, the developer of a massive 960-unit complex planned for the South of Market site of the Creamery restaurant at Fourth and Townsend streets has committed to paying $70 million in affordable housing fees, money that is earmarked to fund more than 300 affordable units at Fifth and Howard streets. But the Creamery project has been delayed by several lawsuits over the Central SoMa neighborhood rezoning plan passed by the Board of Supervisors in December.Falk called Fifth and Howard ‚Äúthe poster child‚Äù of how affordable housing can be dependent on the often fickle marketplace.‚ÄúFifth and Howard can‚Äôt get funded unless the Creamery goes forward,‚Äù Falk said, adding that even with the $70 million there is a $12 million funding gap, he said.The affordable housing fees that have dropped come from three sources of funding: jobs-housing linkage fees, which office developers pay to offset the public services needed for the city‚Äôs growing workforce; inclusionary housing fees, which market-rate housing developers can choose to pay instead of building below-market rate units on site; and neighborhood impact fees, which apply to parts of town, like Rincon Hill and the Market-Octavia area, that have been rezoned in recent years.In total, the fees have dropped each of the last four fiscal years, from $111 million to $58 million to $50 million to $35 million.But Hartley said that the department has enough money, about $441 million, to fund the projects planned for the next fiscal year.That money will help pay for four big Mission District projects totaling 500 units ‚Äî $25 million for 490 South Van Ness Ave., $40 million for 1950 Mission St., $28 million for 2060 Folsom St., and $39 million for 681 Bryant St. It will also go toward rebuilding Potrero Hill and Sunnydale public housing. And $59 million of it will pay for for 178 units of both senior and family housing at Broadway and Davis streets on the northeast waterfront.But while market-rate housing developers are pumping less money into city coffers, affordable housing will benefit from increased political and philanthropic interest in housing the poor and working class.In November, San Francisco voters passed Proposition C, a business tax that would generate about $150 million a year for supportive housing. In January, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced plans to spend $2 billion on affordable housing in the next year. Also in January, a coalition led by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the San Francisco Foundation rolled out a $500 million fund to support Bay Area housing.In addition, Mayor London Breed has announced plans to put an affordable housing bond on the November ballot, most likely for $300 million.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not all doom and gloom,‚Äù Hartley said. ‚ÄúWe are optimistic. There are a lot of resources. We just need to be creative and go after new opportunities as well as we can.‚ÄùThe decrease in fees generated by market-rate projects has prompted some pro-development groups to push for lower inclusionary housing requirements, arguing that some projects are stuck because the fees or on-site requirements are too high.In 2016, San Francisco voters passed a proposition that increased the percentage of buildings subject to affordable housing fees from 20 percent to 30 percent. Developers pay about $200 per square foot on that portion of the project ‚Äî so for a 100,000-square-foot rental housing development, the fee would be about $6 million.Kristy Wang, policy and planning director at the urban think tank SPUR, said that such a move wouldn‚Äôt be realistic with the current progressive-majority Board of Supervisors.‚ÄúThere are reasons to do that, but it‚Äôs hard to picture this board dialing back any affordable housing requirements at this time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEven with the evidence ... it would be a hard public conversation.‚ÄùWhile private developer fees are important, especially when they‚Äôre not being generated, Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corp. Director Falk said they will never be the main source of investment for affordable housing.‚ÄúThe truth is that affordable housing requires a public (tax) subsidy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need subsidies to make up for the marketplace‚Äôs failure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúInclusionary plays an important role but compared to other funding sources, it‚Äôs not a very big number.‚Äù"
51.0,"I wish we had a home video of dinnertime at my house, circa 1992. I was 14 then, my older brother was 16, and our little sister was 10. By then my mother, who had stayed home with us throughout our childhoods, had gone back to work, but she came home and cooked dinner every damn day.Though my high school social life was never much to speak of, my brother had a big group of friends who‚Äôd congregate in his bedroom after school to hang out and play video games ‚Äî at least, that‚Äôs what I assumed they were doing. He had cleverly removed the exterior doorknob from his bedroom, ensuring that once he was inside with his buddies, no one else was coming in, especially his two younger sisters.Dinnertime is what I remember best about that period of our lives. My mother had no way of knowing how many people she‚Äôd be cooking for on any given night. She couldn‚Äôt bear the idea of sending teenagers home hungry ‚Äî some of those kids had parents who worked late, or parents who didn‚Äôt cook, or they were avoiding their own homes for one reason or another. But my mother didn‚Äôt ask any questions, except one: Are you staying for dinner?They always did. My dear mom, who died in early September, was a great cook, and somehow she stretched whatever she was making, loaves-and-fishes-style, into enough to feed any teenager who propped his elbows up on the table. For my mother it was just a meal, one of thousands she made over her lifetime, and inviting them was just the right thing to do. Cooking gave her pleasure (at least most of the time), and seeing the food she‚Äôd prepared wolfed down by a pack of teens must‚Äôve been gratifying. But while she was boiling spaghetti for a crowd, she was also giving me one of my earliest lessons in generosity, in the importance, value and joy of feeding people.A few months ago, a friend stopped by on her way home from work. She intended to make it a quick visit, but we got caught up talking, the clock inching closer to dinnertime. I invited her to stay, and she demurred, not wanting to put me out. My 5-year-old son looked at her and said, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs no big deal. My mom is always cooking something.‚Äù At first I felt a little embarrassed, imagining that my kid only thinks of me here, in this kitchen, making dinner.But when I think back on my own childhood, that‚Äôs what I remember ‚Äî my own mother, always in the kitchen and the wonderful way that made me feel; the wonderful way I think it made her feel. My mother didn‚Äôt cook because she had to ‚Äî plenty of kids do just fine raised on peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches and takeout, I know, and the myth that a home-cooked meal will solve all of the world‚Äôs problems is just that, a myth. She cooked because she loved feeding people, I think. And she passed that delicious legacy on to me.Since my mom died, I‚Äôve been flattened by grief in a way I didn‚Äôt think possible. For weeks, I cooked nearly nothing, relying on friends and scrambled eggs. Not cooking made me feel unmoored, and I knew my mom would have insisted that the show go on. So one Sunday night not too long ago, the memory of her crowding every waking thought, we invited some good, gentle friends for dinner. I braised a chunk of pork shoulder with hoisin and soy sauce, ginger and star anise, and as it cooked and the smell filled our little house, I felt my appetite ‚Äî for dinner and for life ‚Äî returning.Jessica Battilana is a San Francisco freelance writer. Her new cookbook is ‚ÄúRepertoire: All the Recipes You Need.‚Äù Twitter: @jbattilana Email: food@sfchronicle.comSoy-Braised Pork ShoulderServes 6¬Ω cup hoisin sauce6 garlic cloves, peeled and mashed to a paste3¬Ω to 4 pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder, in one chunk¬Ω cup soy sauce¬º cup dry Sherry1 2-inch cinnamon stick2 whole star anise4 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces, smashed with the side of a knife1 2-by-3-inch piece fresh ginger, sliced into ¬º-inch thick coins, smashed with the side of a knife2 tablespoons chopped palm sugar or dark brown sugarCilantro leaves, for garnishInstructions: In a small bowl, mix together the hoisin sauce and the garlic.

53.0,"Punk rock. Experimental architecture. Polish films of the 1950s. These are the inspiration points that Kashy Khaledi cites when describing how he came to found Ashes & Diamonds, Napa‚Äôs latest attempt at a Millennial-friendly winery.‚ÄúThis winery is a concept album,‚Äù the new vintner says. Khaledi is a former executive at Capitol Records, MTV and Live Nation, and a onetime music journalist. (He was the editor in chief of Filter magazine and the publisher of Mean.) The concept, it seems, is to pay homage to old-school Napa ‚Äî to midcentury winemaker legends like Andr√© Tchelistcheff of Beaulieu Vineyard, John Daniel Jr. of Inglenook and Bob Travers of Mayacamas, and to their restrained styles of wine.Like any concept album, Ashes & Diamonds is severely ambitious in scope ‚Äî not only because it‚Äôs a sizable new estate winery and tasting room on the heavily trod, high-visibility thoroughfare of Highway 29. And not just because Khaledi has tapped high-profile winemakers Steve Matthiasson, Dan Petroski and Diana Snowden Seysses to make the wines. (Petroski made wines in 2014 and 2015, but no longer does.) But also because Khaledi has some major shade to throw.In Khaledi‚Äôs view, modern Napa has become too safe, too risk averse, and its wines too homogenous. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this false notion of perfection in Napa that doesn‚Äôt really exist,‚Äù Khaledi says of the valley‚Äôs wines. ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt living with nuances. Site specificity ‚Äî nobody‚Äôs really leading the charge with that.‚ÄùHas Napa gotten lazy, resting on its laurels and churning out overblown, excessively high-octane wines? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bubble here,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI call it ‚ÄòNapathy.‚Äô‚ÄùGranted, the recent wildfires that ravaged Napa County seem to have softened Khaledi‚Äôs stance. Neither the Ashes & Diamonds winery nor the homes of any of its employees were damaged, and all 2017 wines were vinified and in barrel. But Khaledi says he witnessed ‚Äúan awakening of a collective consciousness in the North Bay‚Äù in response to the tragedy. He‚Äôs donating $10 from every bottle sold of the 2014 Vin de Table, a Merlot-Cabernet Franc blend, to Redwood Credit Union‚Äôs North Bay Fire Relief Fund. To visit Ashes & Diamonds, which finished construction the last week of October, is to see the new face of an indulgent Wine Country hospitality whose presence is growing in Napa and Sonoma. The genre‚Äôs prototype is Scribe, that painfully hip Sonoma Valley winery, and Khaledi is conscious of taking a page from Scribe‚Äôs playbook. ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôve done is a miracle,‚Äù he says of Scribe‚Äôs ability to bring Millennials to Wine Country. As you lounge at Ashes & Diamonds, attended by a young staff, a momentary lapse might lead you to believe you‚Äôre at a Silicon Valley tech campus. There‚Äôs even a bike rack. The winery‚Äôs architect, Barbara Bestor, also designed the Beats by Dre headquarters in Los Angeles. Emma Sears, Ashes & Diamonds‚Äô resident chef, who used to work at Scribe, will prepare for you, in a locally crafted Forno Piombo wood-fired oven, a vegetable-heavy snack platter ‚Äî none of those ubiquitous cheese-charcuterie-breadstick assortments allowed.Despite the fact that his father, Darioush Khaledi, has owned Darioush Winery here since 1997, Khaledi grew up in L.A. and didn‚Äôt truly ‚Äúengage with Napa Valley wines,‚Äù he says, until he began drinking trend-bucking producers like Matthiasson and Scholium Project. Theirs is an anti-Napa approach: prizing obscure varieties like Verdelho and Refosco and embracing unorthodox-for-Napa winemaking practices, like skin contact on white grapes or forced carbonation. ‚ÄúNot like what my father does,‚Äù Khaledi says.Khaledi‚Äôs bid to recapture what he calls the optimism of 1970s Napa involves establishing Ashes & Diamonds not only as a winery but also as a ‚Äúcultural center.‚Äù He held a lecture series in September; speakers included Tim Mondavi, Cathy Corison and Paul Draper. Adjacent to the winery, Khaledi is building a ‚Äúpublic park,‚Äù a large grassy area with picnic tables where he hopes Napa residents will come hang. Bring a Frisbee, bring your dog ‚Äî just be sure to make a reservation for a wine tasting first, per county regulations.It‚Äôs easy to get lost as Khaledi espouses his manifesto. He moves from crediting punk band Minor Threat as a guiding influence, to the ‚ÄúWhite Album,‚Äù to John Carpenter‚Äôs ‚ÄúAssault on Precinct 13‚Äù soundtrack. He cites the Case Study Homes, a collaborative architecture project in post-World War II Los Angeles, as inspiration for hiring multiple winemakers. Steve Matthiasson is ‚ÄúTom Waits,‚Äù Dan Petroski is ‚ÄúBrian Eno,‚Äù the property‚Äôs Merlot is ‚ÄúPaul Newman,‚Äù and the Cabernet Franc is ‚ÄúHarry Dean Stanton with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth.‚Äù I had to squint to see the resemblance.In wine style, winery design and cultural inspirations, Khaledi‚Äôs winery could not be more different from his father‚Äôs. Darioush is known for ripe, hedonistic Cabernet and for its equally hedonistic winery, modeled on the ancient city of Persepolis. It‚Äôs comfortably entrenched in the base of wealthy Baby Boomers that forms the bread and butter of high-end Napa wineries. Is that ‚ÄúNapathy‚Äù?Between Khaledi‚Äôs lines is the anxiety of his father‚Äôs influence, though Khaledi rarely mentions Darioush during our afternoon together. He seems reluctant to tell me that his father sold him the property. He says that his involvement in his father‚Äôs winery was always minimal, because the two men have such divergent tastes. For example, ‚Äúmy dad would ask me to recommend a photographer for the winery, and I‚Äôd recommend the Cobrasnake,‚Äù a nightlife photographer whose aesthetic, it‚Äôs safe to say, is pretty much the opposite of opulent Darioush.Among Ashes & Diamonds‚Äô fruit sources is the Georges III Vineyard, owned by Andy Beckstoffer. Once known as Beaulieu Vineyard No 3, Georges III produced some of those old Tchelistcheff wines that Khaledi loves so much. In homage, he and Matthiasson tried to re-create a Tchelistcheff wine, following as closely as possible the practices that the master would have used.That‚Äôs a much more radical premise than it might sound. First, Matthiasson explains, they found a block that was planted to Cabernet Sauvignon Clone 6 ‚Äî sprawl-trained, as the older vines might have been ‚Äîand persuaded Beckstoffer not to irrigate it. He picked the grapes at 21.5 brix, an extraordinarily low sugar level for valley-floor Cab, even by Matthiasson standards. ‚ÄúI was scared...,‚Äù Matthiasson says with a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never picked Cab that early.‚ÄùHe fermented it at a high temperature, forgoing the longer, cooler fermentations now popular. ‚ÄúIt was really thin and weird and had no color initially,‚Äù Matthiasson says. He did a saign√©e, bleeding off some of the juice. And he threw some American oak barrels ‚Äî seriously out of vogue ‚Äî into the mix.That wine, the 2015 Vineyard 1, still tastes thin now, though not entirely weird. It‚Äôs fresh, tasting of candied red cherry, with a high line of acidity. It bears no trace of the cloying coconut flavor that American oak can sometimes impart. Is it drinkable? Definitely. Does it capture the deep, textured complexity of old BVs? No. Is a bottle worth $125? That‚Äôs another question entirely. For the price, I prefer the 2015 Rancho Peque√±o, a nearby Rutherford site owned by Bart and Daphne Araujo, which still has the floral, elegant, acid-driven aspects I expect from Matthiasson‚Äôs winemaking but seems more fully to realize the mandate of its warm, generous place of origin. Do these prices run the risk of alienating Millennials, bike rack notwithstanding? At $35 for ros√©, $45 for the Blanc (my favorite of the lineup, a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon) and $75 to $125 for the red wines, these are aspirational items, even for San Francisco tech denizens whose options have vested. Khaledi may find in time that his customer base more closely resembles Darioush‚Äôs than Scribe‚Äôs.Khaledi is banking big on the tasting room being a draw for customers. Given the winery‚Äôs prime location and its permit to serve food, the hospitality program is poised for success. But Khaledi‚Äôs goal is to sell 95 to 99 percent of his inventory directly, rather than in the wholesale market; with an eventual projected case production of 10,000, that‚Äôs a business model that most wineries would kill for. It‚Äôs a very, very tall order.The winery is still nascent. Maybe Khaledi‚Äôs vision is, too. Once the novelty fades, we‚Äôll find out: Will those authenticity-seeking young people love Ashes & Diamonds? Or will they feel mere Napathy?Esther Mobley is The San Francisco Chronicle‚Äôs wine, beer and spirits writer. Email: emobley@sfchronicle.com IF YOU GO

70.0,"The last few weeks have been overwhelming.When the front pages of our newspaper are inundated with tragic stories of uncontrollable fires, mass shootings, hurricanes and nuclear war threats, the work we do in the food journalism realm can sometimes feel ... insignificant.But not always.Especially when the world is burning around us, food can be a gateway to humanity and culture, to hope and despair. The stories in this collection are important. They are important in telling the story of the Bay Area, its culture and its people. They are important in sharing the role of food during times of crisis, during times of loneliness, times of abandonment, times of senselessness and hopelessness.This dedicated issue ‚Äî Refuge ‚Äî is inspired and assisted by La Cocina, the San Francisco nonprofit that serves as a food-business incubator for low-income women, especially immigrants. Twice a year, La Cocina puts on a powerful show called ‚ÄúF&B: Voices From the Kitchen.‚Äù It‚Äôs billed as a storytelling project that seeks to share voices that are less-often heard. Each show centers around food, through the lens of a singular theme.On Thursday and Friday, Oct. 19-20, La Cocina will tackle the topic of Refuge. Here at the Chronicle, we worked with La Cocina to share some of those stories in our pages. Others will be showcased at the show itself. The ‚ÄúF&B Refuge‚Äù performances will take place at San Francisco‚Äôs Swedish American Hall (Oct. 19, $55) and the San Jose Museum of Art (Oct. 20, $35); tickets can be purchased at www.voicesfromthekitchen.org.Bay Area, we‚Äôre all hurting. We can find refuge together. Please enjoy the stories shared herein: A Vietnamese refugee family that found its way in America. A once-homeless woman who now helps others in the Tenderloin. A bowl of grits that brings comfort from a changing city. A vineyard worker who came to California in hope of a better life.These are stories that more relevant now than ever.Whether lonely, abandoned, unfulfilled or lost, we find solace in the simplest thing ‚Äî our daily bread.Looking ahead, we want to tell your stories.

73.0,"According to London author Yasmin Khan (‚ÄúThe Saffron Tales: Recipes From the Persian Kitchen‚Äù), Oakland chef Reem Assil has been an inspiration, an example of an Arab American woman who not only celebrates heritage, but makes a social and political statement with her work.Khan is in the Bay Area to promote her second cookbook, ‚ÄúZaitoun: Recipes From the Palestinian Kitchen.‚Äù Already a best seller in the United Kingdom, the book is getting tons of buzz here as well.One of Khan‚Äôs Bay Area stops will be a (sold-out) pop-up dinner at Assil‚Äôs eponymous bakery in Oakland‚Äôs Fruitvale neighborhood. A few days before the dinner, the two chefs met over platters of flatbread and fattoush at Assil‚Äôs Jack London Square restaurant, Dyafa, to discuss the state of Arabic food in America, and their respective efforts to use food as a platform for advocacy and social justice.(The following conversation highlights have been edited for clarity and length.)Q: The Chronicle: How did you two meet?Reem Assil: I feel like I‚Äôve known Yasmin forever. We met at Cherry Bombe, when they did it in San Francisco (in 2017), and I was introducing a panel on cultural appropriation in which ‚Äî we said it was like all the brown people on one panel ‚Äî it was all the most amazing women on one panel.Yasmin Khan: It was such a kick-ass group of people.Assil: Preeti Mistry.Khan: Tanya Holland.Assil: Lisa Fetterman was the moderator. It was really, really amazing. I feel like we just hit it off. We met each other in the green room and we just went back. I didn‚Äôt know anything about Yasmin. I didn‚Äôt know about her work. It felt like I was looking at the future me.Khan: We both come from a background of community work and social justice, grassroots work, which is quite unusual in the food world. And both coming to this quite recently in our lives, relatively, there just felt to be a lot of shared understanding. I think that‚Äôs a thread in both of our works ‚Äî you can see that playing out in how we‚Äôve approached talking about food, and seeing the role of food in a wider context.Assil: We‚Äôre on the fringes, so it‚Äôs refreshing to be like, ‚Äúoh, she gets it.‚Äù So I felt like we hit it off right away.Khan: I feel like what you said was just so true, because I think that for those of us that come from a social organizing background, how we see the world and how we see our role in the world has always been there. I think the food world can sometimes exist in sort of a bubble.When I started writing (this book), I consciously made it a book that talked about the reality of what happens to Palestinians. You have to be quite privileged to think that food and politics are separate because actually for most people, whether in the U.S. or Palestine, they‚Äôre not. Your ability to access food, the type of food that‚Äôs available to you, the way your farming communities work, you know, food isn‚Äôt separate from politics in that way. Part of both of our missions is to show that.Assil: And to embrace that. That‚Äôs something very human. I always say, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm Palestinian.‚Äô‚Äù It‚Äôs in my blood. We can‚Äôt separate our existence from the politics, you know, from a very young age. In a way, I feel like I‚Äôm finding my voice. It‚Äôs taken many years to get where I am today, to be able to be so outspoken and unapologetic. Q: Why has ‚ÄúZaitoun‚Äù resonated with readers?Khan: I‚Äôve been traveling around the country and it‚Äôs about halfway through my tour. Ordinary Americans, they want to know what‚Äôs going on. It can be quite hard to see through the noise. As a Brit coming here, (I‚Äôm) seeing how much more contentious it is just to talk about human rights in a place.It‚Äôs very interesting to me that the concept of talking about equality and human rights for a people ‚Äî somehow in the U.S.A. this issue is seen to be controversial, whereas in Europe it isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs something I really wanted to do with the book. Food is such a great way to start a conversation, to bring people in over something and connect with, like, beautiful breads and olives and pickles and sensory things that make you feel happy and alive. And from that start kind of weaving in some of the backstory. Because I think America needs to have this conversation.Assil: That idea of Arab hospitality, it‚Äôs so true. We take people in, but also the table is where we have all the hard conversations. We do not filter. What would it be like if we put the guards down and the food (becomes) the common denominator to make it safe for us to be able to have these real conversations?Ferry Plaza Market: Noon, Saturday, Feb. 16.Book Passage (S.F. store): 1 p.m., Saturday, Feb. 16.Q: How would you describe what‚Äôs happening right now in the Arabic food world?Khan: It feels like a really exciting moment, actually. I feel like there‚Äôs now a movement actually led by Palestinian women to change the narrative on how Palestinians are seen in the food scene.After I finished ‚ÄúThe Saffron Tales,‚Äù which was so clearly about fighting the stereotypes of the Middle East, when I looked at where I could go next for another book, the Palestinian kitchen seemed to be the perfect place to go.An outsider can play a very important role sometimes because the act of bearing witness is very important. (Khan is of Persian-Paskistani heritage.) And as an outsider, what I tried to do in this book is to just bear witness to these stories, and as a travel journalist that‚Äôs what I think my role is. I really believe that what lifts one of us in the Muslim community, it lifts all of us. The common thing we‚Äôre all facing at the moment is the Muslim world being demonized.Assil: Any sort of articulation of Palestinian identity or Palestinian culture, all of a sudden you‚Äôre out front. I knew I would be slightly controversial, but I had no idea like how visceral the reaction (would be) from the right wing.We‚Äôve come a long way. I get (comments) here and there. You know, it‚Äôs scary; it brings you back to your 12-year-old self who‚Äôs dealt with anti-Arab racism. There was a time I didn‚Äôt say I was Palestinian because I was scared to say I was Palestinian. I think times have changed, and people are curious and people are questioning. I feel very fortunate to be in this time and have this platform. I‚Äôm just expressing who I am. I‚Äôm finding my true, authentic self. I feel like that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been deprived of for so many years.Khan: It feels exciting to actually feel like things are actually changing. The success of your restaurant, the success of these books, it feels like we‚Äôre on the shift of something. I think it‚Äôs a generational thing here in the U.S. and that feels exciting.Q: What do you wish people had a better understanding of in terms of the region and its food?Khan: That it‚Äôs nuanced. That it‚Äôs not all the same. When you say Middle Eastern, you‚Äôre talking about so many different cultures. We‚Äôre not all the same. You‚Äôd never say that about Europeans.Assil: We‚Äôre Christians. We‚Äôre Muslims. We‚Äôre Jews. We‚Äôre atheists. I think that is a big thing. I think that knowing the struggles we go through is connected to the struggles here in the U.S. It‚Äôs all connected. We‚Äôre not free until we‚Äôre all free. It‚Äôs true. To see the humanity in others is to see the humanity in yourself, in your own community. I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to build through my food."
76.0,"This Thanksgiving, the Midwife and the Baker, which sells Thomas ‚ÄúMac‚Äù McConnell‚Äôs artisan breads and pastries at farmers‚Äô markets around the Bay Area, is taking a tentative new step: Offering customers the option to pick up their orders at McConnell‚Äôs new bakery in Mountain View.McConnell was a bread-baking instructor at the San Francisco Baking Institute before starting to sell bread out of his wife Jaime‚Äôs San Francisco midwifery practice in late 2015, quickly finding a place at several markets.He has been baking out of the South Bay since May. A few months before, Steve Sullivan, owner of Acme Bakery, offered McConnell a huge boost: Sullivan was moving his Mountain View baking facility into a much larger space in South San Francisco. Would McConnell be interested in taking over the lease and buying his old equipment? It was, McConnell says, a rare opportunity.The move allowed him to expand to one new Sunday market. More critically, for a business that specializes in airy, crusty whole-grain breads, he could install a critical new piece of equipment: a stone-ground grain mill.McConnell‚Äôs father found an old Meadows mill on the East Coast and had it shipped to California, but after years of milling corn it couldn‚Äôt produce fine bread flour. The baker had to grind down the millstones, using simple (electric) hand tools, until they were perfectly flat. Six weeks ago, he hosted a work party where 10 of his friends and co-workers carved furrows all the way around the stones.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs putting out some really beautiful flour now,‚Äù McConnell says: fine, light, suitable for high-end breads. ‚ÄúIt liberates us from the commodity flours.‚Äù He is buying wheat, spelt and other grains from Llano Seco ranch in Chico and Kenter Canyon Farms in Los Angeles. A few recipes still have to be tweaked, but the move also allows him to increase the proportion of whole grain in his ‚Äúwhite‚Äù breads, too.McConnell also hopes to keep expanding beyond the weekend farmers‚Äô markets, opening up his bakery for sales.

Dinner also offered nightly.Now that Ichi Sushi is back to its original corner spot on Mission Street ‚Äî after spending a few years in a larger location a few blocks away ‚Äî it‚Äôs harder to get into at night. But during the day, you can quietly sit down to tekka don ($16), a bowl of sushi rice with big-eye tuna, pickles and tobiko, although the cheapest lunch option is one of the Japanese hot dogs. Swaddled in buttery toasted lobster rolls, the all-beef dogs are brightened by chunks of house-made radish kimchi or ladled over with silky mapo tofu with pork and Sichuan peppercorn, Ichi‚Äôs answer to a chili dog.3369 Mission St. (near 30th); (415) 525-4750. Curry at Cuisine of Nepal   What: Eggplant curry with rice and buttered naan ($12.99)When: 11 a.m.-2:30 p.m. and 4:30-10:30 p.m. Tue.-Sun.No one could make this strange, skinny space at the foot of Bernal Heights work until chef-owner Prem Tamang opened here, bringing along loyal clientele from a previous stint cooking at Little Nepal up the hill, along with a trunk full of Nepalese prayer flags and instruments to hang from the walls. You can taste the care ‚Äî hand-ground spices, fresh curry leaves ‚Äî that goes into each dish on the short menu of curries and tandoori meats.3486B Mission St. (at Cortland); (415) 647-2222.

The Top Shelf Margherita comes with a warm pool of melted mozzarella and homemade Early Girl tomato sauce, held in by a cornicione (ring) of charred, chewy-tender crust. Share it over a wooden bowl of Intermezzo ‚Äî inspired by the chickpea-laden hippie salad from the Berkeley cafe (now called Mezzo) that has sustained generations of Cal students.3299 Mission St. (at 29th); (415) 874-5585. Patio po' boy at Old Devil Moon   What: Seafood Po‚Äô Boy ($15)When: 6-10 p.m. daily, until midnight Fri.-Sat.While the rest of the city is patio-deficient, many of the restaurants and bars on the Mission-Bernal corridor have generous outdoor seating, this bar included. The seafood po‚Äô boy, a thick roll stuffed with fried oysters and gulf shrimp, shredded cabbage and aioli, is a highlight of the short sandwich menu that suits the Southern Gothic decor. The cocktails ($8 to $11) are a draw, though most of the focus is on the craft beer menu, like the Marzen from Sudwerk Brewing Co.3472 Mission St. (at Cortland) Happy hour at Red Hill Station  What: Half-dozen oysters ($1.50 each) with a $6 Albari√±oWhen: 3-6 p.m. daily.The main courses don‚Äôt fall under our $20 bargain cutoff at this tiny seafood spot, all charm with copper-topped tables and sky-blue wainscoting.

Beckoning at all times of the day are breakfast platters of fried sweet plantains with black beans, fresh cheese and sour cream; or casamiento ‚Äî a mixture of fried rice and beans, served with an egg. With their lacy cheese edges and creative stuffings, the pupusas ($3-$3.50 each) are also stellar.3801 Mission St. (at Richland); (415) 647-4000. Chicken at Goood Frikin Chicken  What: Half-chicken meal ($16.50)When: 11 a.m.-9 p.m. daily.Featured on restaurant bargain lists for years, GFC has had to increase prices over time on its succulent marinated chicken, but it remains a great value. The half-chicken meal ($16.50) is big enough for one or two, with either rotisserie or grilled chicken, a big salad, a side dish (like smooth house-made hummus or smoky baba ganoush) and a pile of olive oil-soaked flatbread. The vegetarian plate ($10.95) is another great option with  those same salads plus falafel, dolmas and more of that pita.10 29th St. (at Mission); (415) 970-2428. "
97.0,"Eighteenth, between Guerrero and Dolores, is a top-notch food block. Tartine is the only resident of international renown, but the median quality of the street‚Äôs offerings ‚Äî Delfina and its pizzeria, Bi-Rite and its creamery, Namu Gaji ‚Äî is high. The low point has traditionally been the high-ceilinged, square room on the northwest corner of Guerrero and 18th. During the seven or so years that I was working in the Mission, the space was occupied first by a Pan-Latin place called Platanos, then a forgettable diner called Craig‚Äôs Place. When that closed, the owners reanimated the restaurant as a raw bar called Ebb & Flow, which, in practice, only ebbed.Centuries earlier, this part of town was literally a land of ebb and flow. The expansive tidal marshes running inland from Mission Bay ended right around here. Arroyo Dolores, a stream emanating from a natural spring to the west, once ran almost straight down present-day 18th Street, flanked by cattle-friendly grassland. It‚Äôs a naturally productive area ‚Äî one of the few in San Francisco‚Äôs mostly sandy, shrubby landscape ‚Äî and it encouraged the Spanish to construct Mission Dolores nearby.First-time restaurateur Yuko Hayashi took over the corner of 18th and Guerrero to open Yuzuki in 2011 with something of a mission of her own. First under the guidance of chef Takashi Saito and currently Yoshio Sasaki, the restaurant is geared toward demonstrating classical Japanese techniques and ingredients. There‚Äôs a poster in the bathroom that reads: ‚ÄúIzakaya Yuzuki is the first Japanese restaurant in the U.S. to introduce a unique menu featuring dishes prepared using ‚Äòkoji.‚Äô‚Äù I doubt that that‚Äôs entirely true, but then again, I‚Äôve never put much stock in things you read on bathroom walls.The speciousness of the claim doesn‚Äôt detract from the splendor of the squid yakitori: fins, body and tentacles marinated in koji, grilled, sliced and served with a squeeze of lemon, togarashi and a mayonnaise-y dipping sauce. Each section of the squid lies on a different but equally pleasant part of the crunchy-creamy-chewy spectrum and sings with clean, savory, sweet flavors and a light perfume of charcoal.I wasn‚Äôt familiar with shio koji when Yuzuki first arrived to ‚Äúintroduce its unique menu.‚Äù But now, I have a batch fermenting in my refrigerator, waiting to be deployed as a marinade. The salt (shio) in this wonder-shmoo will season and draw liquid from whatever its target meat is, while the friendly mold Aspergillus oryzae (koji) will break down starches into sugars and proteins into tasty amino acids. It tenderizes while imparting both sweetness and umami. But again, I didn‚Äôt learn about any of this until two or three years ago.Likewise, when I first ate at Yuzuki five years ago, I hadn‚Äôt yet been awakened to the donabe ‚Äî the multipurpose glazed ceramic cooking vessel from Japan that does wonders for all kinds of dishes, but especially rice. One of the big cookbooks last year was the single-subject ‚ÄúDonabe,‚Äù written by Kyle Connaughton and Naoko Takei Moore. Connaughton and his wife, Katina, recently opened the ultra-luxe Single Thread in Healdsburg, where artisanally crafted donabe from Mie Prefecture line the shelves of the kitchen and play a part in every meal. As one of the main courses in an extended tasting menu, a hot donabe is brought to your table by a server who lifts the lid to reveal a precisely and beautifully composed arrangement of fish, flowers, vegetables and herbs over a bed of negi. The waiter then whisks the pot back to the kitchen and returns with the contents precisely portioned onto plates.When I dined at Single Thread a few months ago, that last gesture struck me as strange, like they were wasting the charm of their handmade cookware by not letting diners linger with it. At Yuzuki, when you order a donabe of salmon rice, the pot stays on the table. The rice itself is as perfect as it should be ‚Äî firm but not al dente, not overly sticky and gloriously aromatic. The fish is mild and succulent, and translucent orange pearls of salmon roe are scattered throughout the rice, creating little pockets of sea-salty umami that season each bite. (The roe is an optional add-on, but unless you have some kind of aversion to deliciousness, you should order it.) One donabe is enough to feed two or three, but I could happily take one down myself. At least once every other week, I‚Äôll cook a similar dish at home, a ritual that‚Äôs been improved immensely with the help of ‚ÄúDonabe‚Äôs‚Äù excellent instruction. But I‚Äôll be honest and say that I prefer Yuzuki‚Äôs donabe course to Single Thread‚Äôs.Beyond the keynote menu items, there‚Äôs still a lot more goodness to be had. Yuzuki‚Äôs homemade tofu is delicate, with the jiggle of panna cotta and the faint but unmistakable taste of fresh soybeans. A little bowl of braised beef tendon looks gruesome but tastes glorious, gingery and rich, with a texture like warm gummy bears. Slices of braised duck breast have the familiar sweet-soy profile of many Japanese stews and sauces, but a surprising and welcome meaty chew. And a plate of yaki omusubi ‚Äî four crisp grilled triangles of buttered rice topped with watercress and uni ‚Äî is a perfect accompaniment to cold Japanese lager.Like any izakaya worth its salt, Yuzuki has a menu of daily specials from which you can order things like a soup of sake lees, with fish, tofu and vegetables ‚Äî a parade of different textures in a broth that has an irresistibly sweet and lightly alcoholic aroma, like Jackson Playground while the Anchor Steam brewery is cooking.Yuzuki‚Äôs been humming along quietly for almost six years now. It‚Äôs received a little bit of press, including in The Chronicle, but it rarely comes up in conversations about the city‚Äôs outstanding restaurants. The boxiness of the room continues to be somewhat resistant to decoration or reconfiguration ‚Äî the restaurant succeeds in spite of its style ‚Äî but I still don‚Äôt really understand why it‚Äôs not busier.Restaurateurs like to talk about cursed spaces, places where no chef or concept can seem to get a foothold. I‚Äôm guilty of buying into this superstition myself. I left my office in the Mission around the time that Yuzuki opened, but in the years since then, I‚Äôve only visited the restaurant once or twice. I wrote it off, thinking there was no way anything that opened in that spot could ever make it.But the notion of cursed spaces runs somewhat contrary to the timeworn saying about location that Realtors and restaurateurs love to recite like a Hindu mantra. There is, I think, much more truth in location. As far removed as we may seem from the time when 18th Street was an idyllic spring-fed gully, I like to believe that the block is great for restaurants because it‚Äôs an inherently fertile piece of land. Like all organic bodies, cities depend on the land, and succeed best when the right seeds are planted in the right places. (I‚Äôve been comforting myself with this thought lately as I‚Äôve watched my billionaire neighbor buy and convert a second residential property into a private basketball court. I‚Äôm hopeful that the earth will reject this invasive species.)Anyway, it turns out there are no cursed restaurants. It comes down to the right idea taking root, and, when something great begins to grow from it, diners nurturing it. Chris Ying is a writer, editor and co-founder of Lucky Peach.

113.0,"Look at the market stalls and there‚Äôs no denying that summer is beginning its inevitable fade. Days are getting shorter, the kids are  back in school and Halloween candy is already appearing on store shelves. Let‚Äôs face it: Fall and pumpkin-spice lattes are just around the corner.For those who cling to the flavors of summertime ‚Äî freshly shucked and grilled corn, fresh-baked cobblers made with berries from your favorite U-pick farm ‚Äî the good news is that some late-in-the-season crops should  carry that carefree summer spirit well into October. Here‚Äôs what to make.Figs Earlier this month, while I was checking out the new pop-up Bayview Farmers‚Äô Market at Yosemite Avenue and Keith Street, I indulged in  hot-off-the-griddle strawberry pancakes at Craftsman and Wolves‚Äô corner cafe. Walking off my  breakfast, I spied lovely pints of black mission, calimyrna and brown turkey figs and had an epiphany ‚Äî thinly sliced ripe figs, sprinkled with a bit of sugar, would be a wonderful addition to buttermilk pancakes.In a large bowl, combine 2 cups  all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda and ¬Ω teaspoon kosher salt. In a separate bowl, beat 2 large eggs, then whisk in 2 cups buttermilk, ¬Ω cup whole milk and ¬º cup melted butter.Over medium-high heat, lightly oil a griddle with vegetable oil or clarified butter. While the griddle is heating up, add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring just enough to combine but not overworking the batter (there will still be lumps).When the griddle is hot, pour ¬Ω cup batter per pancake. Place several thin slices of fresh fig on top of the batter for each pancake, and sprinkle the figs with a pinch or two of granulated sugar. When bubbles form on the surface of the batter and the bottom of the pancakes are golden brown, flip and cook until the newly flipped side is golden and the figs and sugar have caramelized slightly.Serve warm with butter and maple syrup.GrapesAs a kid, my mom would freeze whole grapes and give them to me as a summertime snack. To this day, when it comes to the fruit, for the most part I prefer them  chilled and without adornment. That said, in recent years I‚Äôve enjoyed grapes in more unexpected forms like Tartine Manufactory‚Äôs PB&J ice cream pie made with concord grape and fior di latte soft serve.A colleague suggested a savory grape salsa or chutney-like condiment that would go well with  pork, chicken or fish. I was sold, but I couldn‚Äôt decide whether I‚Äôd want the grape condiment hot or cold, so I opted for both.For the warm version: Heat 2 tablespoons grape seed oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ¬º cup finely chopped shallots and cook until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add 1 minced clove of garlic, ¬Ω teaspoon mustard seeds, 3 cups red seedless grapes, removed from the stem, plus 1 teaspoon of sugar. Saute for a minute or two to soften the grapes, then add ¬º cup Sherry vinegar and cook for 1 minute more. Add 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme. Taste and adjust the seasoning with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.To make a cool and tangy fresh grape salsa: In a large bowl, combine 2 tablespoons diced shallots, ¬Ω teaspoon finely minced garlic, ¬º to ¬Ω teaspoon finely chopped serrano pepper, 2 cups halved red or green seedless grapes (or a combination of both) with 1 tablespoon Sherry vinegar and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Add 1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.OkraOkra‚Äôs potential slime factor may be enough to turn people off, but I can‚Äôt get enough of the seed pods. Although I don‚Äôt really mind the slime too much, I do prefer that my okra be nice and crispy. This usually means tossing the pods with a bit of olive oil, kosher salt and ground black pepper and roasting at high heat, but I also love it pickled or dredged in flour and cornmeal and deep-fried. These are all worthy preparations, but I was craving something a little different when I came across a recipe in ‚ÄúDeepa‚Äôs Secrets: Slow Carb/New Indian Cuisine‚Äù (Skyhorse Publishing; $24.99), a new cookbook from Deepa Thomas, a San Francisco textile entrepreneur-turned-author. As bhindi masala is one of my go-to dishes at Indian restaurants, I had to try Thomas‚Äô crackling okra ‚Äî thinly sliced and sauteed in coconut oil until just al dente, then enrobed in a mixture of shredded coconut, chile, garlic, turmeric and curry leaves that have been blitzed in a food processor. It is a stunning dish and one that I‚Äôll add to my summertime rotation.Place 3 cloves garlic, ¬º teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 cup shredded coconut, ¬º teaspoon turmeric, ¬º teaspoon  asafoetida (you should be able to find this pungent spice at Indian markets, but if you can‚Äôt, simply omit), 1 teaspoon white vinegar, 4 curry leaves (also available at Indian markets), 1 teaspoon kosher salt and ¬Ω teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in a food processor and pulse until you have a rough consistency, about 20 to 30 seconds.Heat 3 tablespoons coconut oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds and 1 teaspoon split urad dal (black lentils). When the dal begins to brown, add 1 whole jalape√±o, split down the middle with the stem intact. Saute for 1 minute then add 1 finely chopped shallot and cook for another 2 minutes.Add the shredded coconut mixture and saute for 2 minutes. Add 3 cups fresh okra, sliced into ¬º-inch pieces, increase heat to high and saute for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, drizzle with a squeeze of lemon juice and serve immediately.MelonWith the exception of watermelon, melons almost always strike me as overly perfumed and too sweet. Typically, I like my fruit on the tart and tangy side, and I kept thinking about how much I enjoy watermelon-rind pickles. Then it struck me: quickly pickled melons.In a small sauce pan, combine 2 teaspoons kosher salt, ¬Ω cup sugar, ¬Ω cup rice vinegar, 1 cup water, ¬Ω teaspoon black peppercorns, 1 piece star anise, 1 jalape√±o pepper, thinly sliced into rings, and 1 shallot, thinly sliced. Place over medium-high heat, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, stirring until the sugar and salt have dissolved completely. Remove from the heat and let cool.Peel and remove the seeds from 1 large firm yet ripe melon (Sharlyn or piel de sapo melons work nicely). Cut into bite-size cubes, place in a large bowl and cover with the cooled pickling liquid. Cover with plastic wrap and let the melon marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.Remove the melon from the pickling liquid and serve the pickled melon alongside prosciutto and other cured meats, or toss in a salad with fresh melon for a tangy contrast to the naturally sweet fruit.

116.0,"I. JANUARYWhen I sat down with Christian Albertson and Nat Cutler in a wooden booth at Monk‚Äôs Kettle in the first month of 2017, the mood was cautiously upbeat. The duo ‚Äî owners of the 16th Street beer bar and restaurant since 2007 ‚Äî had faced a rough gantlet in the previous year but felt stronger for it as they entered their 10th year in business.The year 2016, they said, was different from every year that had come before.‚ÄúWe‚Äôd had eight years that you could predict,‚Äù said Cutler. In the past, they could look at the records and estimate their earnings for any given day quite accurately. ‚ÄúWe used to be able to say exactly what we‚Äôd do every day of week 34.‚ÄùBut in the previous 12 months, that had changed, he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just been off.‚Äù‚ÄúAt first, we weren‚Äôt sure if it was just us,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúand weren‚Äôt sure how far it was going to go.‚ÄùAlbertson had his theories, many of which centered around a changing San Francisco. He recounted how, all of a sudden, it seemed that a drastic drop-off in customers occurred whenever there was a snowy weekend in Tahoe, a new development for the neighborhood. ‚ÄúYou have this mass exodus,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn 2012, you didn‚Äôt have millionaires that were the only ones that lived here ‚Äî and they just went away and went skiing.‚ÄùThere were other theories: He felt that tech employees might not feel the need to go out when meals were provided at work, and those who didn‚Äôt work in tech were feeling the pinch financially and choosing to go out less.Or could it be, Cutler wondered, that the city had simply reached its restaurant saturation point?The Monk‚Äôs Kettle team acted fast, cutting staffing by 20 percent toward the end of 2016 and shortening the restaurant-bar‚Äôs hours on Sunday through Wednesday nights: ‚ÄúWe used to see a lot of late-night (business),‚Äù said Albertson, noting that the customers sticking around until 2 a.m. were predominantly employed in the restaurant industry.‚ÄúWho else is coming for a burger at midnight on a Tuesday, having a couple of beers and food?‚Äù he said. But even that crowd had been slowing, as many moved outside the city. ‚ÄúNow they all have to catch BART. Or their income is down because their restaurants aren‚Äôt doing as well.‚ÄùShortly after announcing Monk‚Äôs Kettle‚Äôs new hours, the team found out that Nopa ‚Äî still one of the most popular restaurants in San Francisco ‚Äî was similarly curtailing its own late-evening service. That was a huge signal for the state of affairs, said Albertson: ‚ÄúNo one has that late-night business.‚ÄùAnd while they‚Äôd secured a reasonable 10-year lease with an option for five more in 2014 ‚Äî ‚Äúamazing timing,‚Äù said Cutler ‚Äî Monk‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt immune to the impact of the booming real estate market. Mike O‚ÄôBrian, who‚Äôd been the chef for the past year, put in his notice in the fall, citing the high cost of rent in the Bay Area.The chef‚Äôs exit forced a re-evaluation of the menu. Together with a new chef and other members of the team, they combed through old menus to consider what items to bring back ‚Äî mac and cheese, bone marrow ‚Äî and which dishes that were salvageable, such as a chicken entree that took too long to cook.They reconsidered the menu format, too, expanding the snack offerings since few customers still ordered a traditional salad, entree and dessert. ‚ÄúIt was the most productive, open meeting with everything on the table and everyone throwing out ideas,‚Äù Cutler said.Albertson added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all in it together; there‚Äôs no front of house and back of house.‚ÄùII. MAYFour months later, Albertson and Cutler looked world-weary.They had yet another new chef to announce; things hadn‚Äôt worked out with their January hire. However, they weren‚Äôt planning another menu revamp: ‚ÄúIf it had been executed properly at the start, the staff would have been excited and happy,‚Äù said Cutler. ‚ÄúBut instead it was like, this reads well but it doesn‚Äôt always come out well, and so then it‚Äôs hard to be confident in what you‚Äôre selling.‚ÄùThere was some good news: The proportion of sales from food had edged up an average of 2 percentage points, from the 49 to 51 percent range up to 51 to 53 percent since they‚Äôd increased the number of snacky, sharable items. Cutler credited impulse-purchase items like deviled eggs (3,100 sold), pretzels (1,811 sold) and shishito peppers (1,141 sold) for those gains.On the bar side, beer sales hadn‚Äôt shifted at all: draft beers at Monk‚Äôs have always accounted for about 33 to 35 percent of total sales, with bottles making up 7.5 to 9.5 percent.Albertson and Cutler found their second chef of the year, Matthew Woods, through Instawork, a career marketplace app. Woods was briefly the chef de cuisine at Alba Ray‚Äôs on Mission, and had previously cooked at Schmidt‚Äôs on 20th Street.Pointing to four new iPads on the back wall lighting up with to-go orders, Cutler said that delivery now accounted for about 5 percent of sales. ‚ÄúYou have an entire portion of the population that uses these to-go apps,‚Äù he said, noting that while some quick-service spots were getting a huge amount of delivery business, ‚Äúas an industry, it hurts, because you‚Äôre not getting that brick-and-mortar business.‚ÄùCutler said that overall sales in the first quarter were noticeably down when compared to the early, successful months of 2016. But May was roughly where he thought it would be ‚Äî about even with May 2016. Just in case, he projected that the rest of the year would be a couple of points down on any given month. He would make a point to keep an eye on lunch service and Thursday‚Äôs ‚Äúhit or miss‚Äù late-night sales.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been sitting here on this corner for 10 years now,‚Äù Albertson said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been watching San Francisco change, we‚Äôve been watching the Mission change, we‚Äôve been watching the restaurant industry change, we‚Äôve been watching the craft beer industry change. Everything has been shifting. And we‚Äôve had a front-row-seat view. How you get to 10 years is nonstop change.‚ÄùIII. OCTOBERWhen asked about plans for their big anniversary at the end of the year, Cutler said they were thinking ‚Äúsmall but cool.‚Äù He was hesitant to plan a blowout that would cost tens of thousands of dollars: ‚ÄúWhat if we don‚Äôt have it? Then you‚Äôve got your Fyre Festival in the Mission.‚ÄùBefore the anniversary celebrations, though, there was a summer of events. One was a huge success: Monk‚Äôs was tapped to be the sole food vendor in Outside Lands‚Äô beer area; they sold about 2,000 sausages and 6,000 pretzels over the course of the three-day festival.But their yearly Sourfest celebration was mixed: In 2016 it had yielded a 40 or 50 percent jump in sales; the 2017 version boosted the day‚Äôs sales just 12 percent. Albertson wondered if he‚Äôd failed to promote the event enough, but also noted that the general availability of sours now is quite different from what it was in Monk‚Äôs Kettle‚Äôs early days.Back in 2007, Albertson and Cutler worried that they might not sell enough sour beer to get through a single small keg and had to encourage customers to try free tastes of the once-unfamiliar tart brews. In some ways, the success of the bar‚Äôs educational mission worked to the detriment of events like Sourfest: While not exactly commonplace, these once exceedingly rare beers have taken off, and there are many more venues for tasting sour beers in the Bay Area today. ‚ÄúExclusivity is a disappearing term,‚Äù pronounced Cutler.Sayre Piotrkowski, who started working at Monk‚Äôs as a busser in 2008, and served as assistant beer director before he left in 2011, credits the bar and restaurant with a huge amount of influence on the local beer scene: ‚ÄúBecause of our location and late-night hours, we boasted some of the most influential restaurant industry professionals as regulars.‚Äù Piotrkowski remembers closing shifts where he‚Äôd look up and down the bar and see nearly every seat full of servers, sommeliers and cooks from top restaurants, including Delfina, Bar Tartine, 54 Mint, Slanted Door and Cotogna. ‚ÄúWe turned lots of influential people onto unfamiliar brewers from around the world and in their own backyard.‚ÄùBut looking at the numbers, Cutler and Albertson decided to continue to scale back late-night hours on Thursdays as well as earlier in the week. ‚ÄúWe tell the staff, if you‚Äôre busy, you can stay open,‚Äù said Albertson, but he added that he believes that ‚Äúthe demographic‚Äôs just not there. Do we think that late-night is going to come back to the city? No.‚ÄùThey took a hard look at nearby restaurants and other spots in the city serving sandwiches and burgers, and realized that their prices felt high in comparison. They had seen people come in, sit down, look at the menu, then get up to leave.‚ÄúThere are so many places now. It‚Äôs a new landscape, and there are different business models,‚Äù Albertson said. ‚ÄúOur prices were close to the top.‚ÄùThe contrast felt especially uncomfortable on the delivery apps, where comparison-shopping is easy. While delivery had accounted for 5 percent of sales in January, Cutler said that by October, it made up 8 to 12 percent of each month‚Äôs revenue. ‚ÄúIf we want to compete better, we have to price ourselves differently.‚ÄùIn the hope of luring more customers to eat, they made tweaks. The onion jam-topped burger, which had crept up to $18 for a plate served with fries or salad, was changed to an a la carte option at $14, with optional fries or mixed greens available for an additional $3.50. They added two additional sandwiches, also a la carte. Entree prices were lowered as well. ‚ÄúEven if you were never going to get that steak at $29, just it being there says, ‚ÄòOh, this place is expensive.‚Äô‚Äù Albertson said. ‚ÄúIt will be interesting to see if that continues to happen. The entry-level is easier to face now.‚ÄùCutler and Albertson took a close look at the beer list as well, lowering prices by $1 on drafts offered by the pint and adding a more-affordable bottle or can option ‚Äî priced at $5.50 to $6.50 ‚Äî in several beer styles.‚ÄúWe have to meet people where they are,‚Äù said Cutler.These were difficult decisions to make. Cutler estimated that the cost of beef has gone up 10 percent in the past two years. Back-of-house wages have increased about 20 percent over the past five years, and wages overall have risen 53 percent since 2007.According to Albertson‚Äôs records, popular beers like Pliny, Allagash White and Moonlight Reality Czech all cost $30 more per keg than they did in 2008. While that comes out to about 25 cents more per pint, that small-sounding cost adds up to about $12,600 if you sell 140 pints per day, 360 days a year.‚ÄúIt is much harder now to make a profit in this business, but we have learned an awful lot in the last decade,‚Äù said Albertson. He had been reflecting on the closing of Monk‚Äôs short-lived fine-dining sibling, Abbot‚Äôs Cellar, in 2015. Both partners still refer to that experience as traumatic. But it was also valuable, said Albertson: ‚ÄúMy father-in-law said that we should look at our experience (at Abbot‚Äôs) as the street equivalent of an MBA. The lessons we learned from that project are numerous: risk evaluation; price/value perception and customer accessibility; proactive problem solving and better long-term thinking. Abbot‚Äôs gave us insight into the many ways a place can fail and gave us a road map for avoiding pitfalls going forward.‚ÄùIV. INTO DECEMBERI wanted to check in on the price-adjusting experiment before Monk‚Äôs Kettle‚Äôs anniversary celebrations began in early December, especially since Albertson and Cutler were nervous about instituting the change. But when I arrived on Nov. 29, they were grinning. ‚ÄúWhen you cut prices that significantly, you‚Äôre really hoping volume goes up,‚Äù said Cutler. ‚ÄúOtherwise you just shot yourself in the foot. But we‚Äôve seen no decrease in overall revenue, which is stellar.‚ÄùAnd there were some jumps: In the 20 days before the price cut on all the beers served by the pint (a category that includes staples like pale ales, pilsners, ambers, some IPAs and a few stouts), they‚Äôd sold about 144 pints a day; Cutler estimates that in November 2016, they averaged about 140 pints a day.In the 20 day period after the adjustment, volume was up to 158 pints a day. Adding more lower-cost bottles and cans (and adjusting prices on others) to make sure there was an affordable option in most categories made less of an impact. The difference was a total of about one more can or bottle each day.The adjustments to the food side of the menu had a more striking story to tell: Since going a la carte and adding more sandwiches ‚Äî including a freshly ground lamb burger served with Spanish goat cheese, red onion and arugula ‚Äî customers had ordered 10 more sandwiches a day, including almost 300 lamb burgers since Nov. 6. When considered together, total burger sales leaped 30 percent over October‚Äôs numbers. And about 73 percent of sandwich-eaters added-on: either fries, salad or a cup of soup. The new top-selling entree was a surprise: The vegetarian poblano tamale dish outsold both steak and bricked chicken.The changes felt right to Cutler and Albertson, who said they hope to see an ongoing (if slow) uptick in business as more people realize that Monk‚Äôs is less expensive than it was. ‚ÄúThis seems to be working,‚Äù Albertson said.Looking back, Albertson said they realized that over the years they‚Äôd tried to push the envelope ‚Äî perhaps too far.‚ÄúWe tried to elevate everything. We had $30 entrees that were served with beer pairings, but we just want to be a neighborhood tavern that focuses on craft beer. We still have the cloth napkins, the nicer touches. But people want a burger. So now we‚Äôre giving them two.‚ÄùThey feel re-energized. Early in the year, Cutler proposed to Albertson that they ‚Äútreat this place like a startup,‚Äù beginning a huge re-evaluation of their goals and their audience.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to be a pioneer,‚Äù Cutler said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs another to adapt and become an institution.‚Äù"
121.0,"For those looking for something other than a peace lily,dracaena or rubber plant for their home, let me introduce you to the world of growing succulents indoors. To many a customer‚Äôs surprise, there are a great many succulents that will be happy indoors for an extended period, if not for life. By succulent I refer to traditional cacti, common soft succulents such as crassula, echeveria and sempervivum, as well as two genera that actually like being indoors ‚Äî gasteria and haworthia. In fact, with the exception of aloes, agaves and most yuccas, most plants classified as succulents can be successfully grown inside.The two most important factors for keeping indoor succulents happy are bright light and good drainage. These are easily accomplished by keeping them near a window and by adding pumice, perlite or small stones to the soil for effective drainage.Get creativeCreating a mixed succulent bowl has become very popular these days. At its simplest, this is combining two to six small succulents in a decorative container. Although there are no strict rules, most people seek variety. That is accomplished with the color of the leaves (wide ranging) and their shape (skinny, wide, vertical, horizontal) and forms (prickly tubular cacti, smooth or pebbled succulent). There are a few practical considerations. Keep in mind the mature size of the individual succulents and how fast they‚Äôll grow (don‚Äôt crowd at the beginning). Put larger specimens toward the rear, and keep in mind their aesthetic relation to each other.Likely candidatesI‚Äôll nominate several genera here as a starting point. Echeverias are a popular choice, with their lotus-like shapes and pastel colors. Hens and chicks (sempervivum) also stay low and make multiple rosettes. For height, try kalanchoes and crassulas. Barrel cacti provide a nice vertical element and attractive spines. As noted above, haworthia and gasterias are great additions, grow slowly (a plus), and most add dark green tones for contrast. The possibilities for your mixed succulent planter are nearly endless.Contain yourselfThis is mostly an aesthetic decision, but it is worth noting that ceramic containers are popular, as are rough-textured desert-style cement or unglazed clay pots. Once everything is planted, adding pebbles on the surface is a popular addition.AvailabilityIt has become easier to find cacti and succulents in 2- to 4-inch pots. If you‚Äôre doing a mixed bowl, you‚Äôll need to start with smaller specimens. If you‚Äôre just using a single plant, then larger is better, given how slow most succulents grow.Earl Nickel is an Oakland nurseryman and freelance writer. Email: food@sfchronicle.comHow to: Potting dos and don‚ÄôtsDrainage is important, so use a pot that has a drainage hole. Customers sometimes have a favorite small pot with no drainage hole, but this rarely works.Although the material of the container doesn‚Äôt matter (ceramic, terra-cotta, plastic, eco-forms), it is best to choose a somewhat shallow pot. This, too, will help with drainage. The exception is if you are growing a single succulent that will get tall (like certain aeoniums). These will eventually need a deeper pot for the roots and most likely a weighty pot that won‚Äôt topple.Use a 50-50 mix of potting soil and pumice or perlite for succulents. Simple is best."
127.0,"The book ‚ÄúGardenlust: A Botanical Tour of the World‚Äôs Best New Gardens‚Äù by Christopher Woods (Timber Press, 416 pages, $40) shows you gardens from around the globe, including some surprising places such as Oman, Singapore and the island of Nevis in the West Indies, all of them created in the past 20 years. Fifty gardens or designers are featured. The sites are all engaging; some are breathtaking.Woods, the author and major photographer of the book, began his career as a gardener at Kew Gardens in London. He then worked at a number of public gardens in England and the U.S., including 20 years as director and chief designer of Chanticleer Arboretum in Pennsylvania. (I have been to Chanticleer and have seen the Ruins Garden he created there from the stone and slate ruins of the home of the original owner of the property. It‚Äôs a spectacular piece of garden art, which includes  the work of Berkeley garden sculptor Marcia Donahue.)Because Woods understands the need for well-planned garden form as well as for horticultural skill and knowledge, he gives us both perspectives in ‚ÄúGardenlust.‚Äù You will learn the names and view the work of forward-looking garden designers the world over. You will also find discussions of certain soils and for important plants in each garden, their common as well as scientific names down to the often all-important cultivar name.I also enjoyed Woods‚Äô explorations of some common themes in gardens of our new century. One of these themes is conservation through cultivation ‚Äî bringing native plants into gardens to ensure their survival. One of many examples is Pad Te Ke Botanical Garden in Laos, where 250 of that nation‚Äôs 485 native orchids are being grown. Another is the Jard√≠n de Salvias in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where a former Buenos Aires professor, Rolando Ur√≠a, has initiated a collection of salvia species. (I was particularly taken with a photograph of Salvia foveolata, a tall salvia species with light yellow flowers and dark red sepals.)A second common theme is environmental remediation. One example is the Naples Botanical Garden, in Naples, Fla., where a former shopping complex, garbage dump and parking lot has become a tropical paradise. Or consider Landschaftspark, in Duisburg-Nord, Germany, where the ruins of the former Thyssen smelting plant, which openly used slave labor during World War II,  is being redesigned into a park. Writes Woods: ‚ÄúHealing the wounds of history does not mean the expurgation of the past.‚Äù Here, the machinery that was used to create chemical and social toxins decays in place amid places to stroll, dance and play.A third theme is bringing nature into the hearts of our overcrowded cities. In Tokyo, Ichigaya Forest is being planted in open spaces between tall buildings. Here, native species are being allowed to form their usual untidy but wonderful forest mix, interrupted only by sidewalks taken by workers to and from their city jobs. Other urban plantings are on roofs or walls. In Singapore, exuberant plantings perch on concrete platforms several stories up, like shelf fungi on a tree.A fourth trend is a less formal style of gardening in which plantings appear to represent wild habitats, though only a portion of the plants used are truly native. Although a certain amount of reseeding and spreading is allowed, such plantings are nevertheless carefully curated and edited. This trend is also represented by the High Line in New York. (Not shown in this book. See the book ‚ÄúGardens of the Highline,‚Äù Piet Oudolf and Rick Darke, Timber Press, 2017, which I reviewed in this column in June 2018). Woods shows and comments on several such ‚Äúnaturalistic‚Äù plantings. But, although the plantings are casual, they do require maintenance. Woods writes that he found the garden created for 2012 Olympics in London Olympic Park in such poor maintenance that ‚Äúeven benign neglect has been neglected.‚Äù  Other gardens, such as Junto Farm, a private garden in Hudson Valley, N.Y., and the public Martin Luther King Park in Paris, merit his high praise for both planting and maintenance.Threaded through the entries is much analysis of this trend. Woods calls it ‚Äúa relaxed interpretation of nature, seeking not to overpower but to cohabit,‚Äù and says such plantings can ‚Äúserve as a bridge between us and what we think of as untamed nature.‚Äù Nevertheless, he says, ‚Äúthere should be no pretense that they aren‚Äôt artificial.‚Äù That is, it should be clear that these gardens are not restorations of meadows and prairies that are truly gone.The book gains value in my eyes by the fact that over half of the gardens are public, and therefore visitable should you travel to where they are. Some are relatively near. For example, the Chihuly garden in Seattle where colored glass art plays against plants, or the Garden of Flowering Fragrance, a Chinese garden at the Huntington Botanical Garden in San Marino (Los Angeles County). Others are farther away, but who knows, life might take you to Sydney to stroll the modern abstract landscapes of the Australian Garden in the Royal Botanic Gardens, or to Said-Ul-Azaib, Delhi, India, to enjoy the contemplative splendor of the Garden of the Five Senses.Pam Peirce is the author of ‚ÄúGolden Gate Gardening.‚Äù Visit her website, www.pampeirce.com Email: food@sfchronicle.com"
132.0,"Some old bars are notable because they have a historical quirk: They were a legendary bordello during Prohibition or the site of the first-ever internet transmission. We‚Äôve got several bars that vie for the distinction of being San Francisco‚Äôs oldest, plus longtime watering holes with open-mike nights that inadvertently serve as breeding grounds for budding music stars. There‚Äôs a bar in Colma, our own necropolis, that swears it‚Äôs haunted.But some old bars are notable simply for the company they keep. O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs, a 45-year-old Irish bar at Fifth Avenue and Balboa Street in the Inner Richmond, is neither the oldest bar nor the smallest bar nor the weirdest bar in San Francisco. It‚Äôs an old-school bar, one that has blissfully sat out the mixology era, and a no-nonsense bar. It‚Äôs a neighborhood spot, a ritual for its regulars.There are other such bars in San Francisco. In fact, there are other such bars in the Richmond (see especially: Hockey Haven). What makes O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs unique ‚Äî what makes it great ‚Äî is its longtime proprietor and leading lady, Annie O‚ÄôKeeffe. Thanks to her, O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs is a home, and like any home it has its own unrepeatable idiosyncrasies and personalities.‚ÄúAnnie is the informal mayor of the Richmond,‚Äù says retired Richmond District police Capt. Richard Correia, who first came to O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs in 1982.Petite and perpetually sporting an amused grin, O‚ÄôKeeffe can usually be found sitting in a rolling desk chair behind her bar. She knows her customers and their dogs by name and frequently offers treats to both. A box of chocolates is a common offering, unless it happens to be the birthday of one of her regulars, in which case O‚ÄôKeeffe will have picked up a cake at Schubert‚Äôs Bakery for the occasion.Weekday afternoons see the first wave of folks, who come in every day to read their books and pass time together. ‚ÄúThey bring in cold cuts and cookies,‚Äù says O‚ÄôKeeffe. On Friday nights, a group of 30-somethings comes in to play darts. In an earlier era, O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs was a haven for overworked Chronicle columnists ‚Äî Herb Caen and Warren Hinckle were fixtures, O‚ÄôKeeffe says ‚Äî and police officers just getting off the day watch.‚ÄúThey‚Äôd ask for a 7Up, and you‚Äôd know to dilute it‚Äù with some alcohol, O‚ÄôKeeffe laughs.O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs is a bar for retired bartenders. Kevin McGovern, who used to bartend at the Philosopher‚Äôs Club, comes in at least once a week. ‚ÄúI come here for Annie,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs home. You don‚Äôt find a bar like this in the city anymore.‚ÄùCarol ‚ÄúFuji‚Äù Fujioka retired from bartending at the Hearth, just a few blocks up on Geary, 11 years ago. A resident of the neighborhood for more than 50 years, she first came into O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs at the suggestion of one of her Hearth customers. Now, she and her dog, Lani, can be spotted at the bar most days in the early evening ‚Äî a Gentleman Jack on the rocks for Fuji, and a water bowl for Lani ‚Äúwith just a dash of beer,‚Äù she says.Bobby Correia, Richard‚Äôs son, walks over to Fuji and hands her a shot of Jameson. ‚ÄúAre you gonna make your potato salad for Super Bowl Sunday again, Fuji?‚Äù he asks. She is. He swears it‚Äôs the best potato salad he‚Äôs ever had.McGovern recalls a Van Morrison sighting several years back. ‚ÄúOh yeah, he‚Äôs been in a few times,‚Äù O‚ÄôKeeffe confirms. What was Van Morrison like? ‚ÄúSame as he is now ‚Äî bollocks!‚Äù she laughs, walking away.What about the bar has changed since the ‚Äô70s? ‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù O‚ÄôKeeffe says, ‚Äúexcept there was none of this fancy Tequila.‚Äù Pointing to a bottle of Fernet, she says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never seen one of these until a couple of years ago. Apparently people love it.‚ÄùYou can order a shot of Fernet Branca or Cazadores, but don‚Äôt ask O‚ÄôKeeffe for a margarita: She refuses to make anything that could be construed as a cocktail. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be worried I‚Äôd screw it up,‚Äù she says. Better to stick with shots and beers.‚ÄúA woman came in once and asked for a ‚Äòsex on the beach,‚Äô‚Äù O‚ÄôKeeffe says. ‚ÄúI told her to take the 31 Balboa out to the ocean.‚ÄùAnother thing you can‚Äôt get at O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs: draft beer. ‚ÄúIt just seemed like too much legwork‚Äù to deal with kegs, says O‚ÄôKeeffe. In addition to the standard domestics (Coors Light, Budweiser) and imports (Corona, Stella, Pacifico), however, you can find IPAs from Drake‚Äôs and Lagunitas. All bottles are $4.O‚ÄôKeeffe is the steward of this community, but she didn‚Äôt create it by herself. The bar was founded by her husband, Tim, who died of cancer in 1997. He remains present: The dimly lit, hand-painted sign outside still reads ‚ÄúO‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs Annie & Tim,‚Äù and a photograph of him hangs on the wall behind where O‚ÄôKeeffe sits in her desk chair.The O‚ÄôKeeffes met in the mid-1970s, when Tim came into Crocker Bank, where Annie was working. They had one fundamental thing in common: Both had emigrated from Ireland. Annie was born in County Leitrim, Tim in County Cork. She arrived in San Francisco in 1972 to attend her brother‚Äôs wedding and never left. (Of her 11 siblings, seven relocated to San Francisco.) When she met Tim at the bank, he invited her to come to his bar for a drink. He‚Äôd recently taken over the space that had formerly been Hennessy‚Äôs bar and was transforming it into a proper Irish pub.By 1977, O‚ÄôKeeffe was working at the bar herself; the couple married four years later. They dedicated themselves to the cause of Irish independence, hosting fundraisers and meetings for the Irish National Aid Association. In 1994, the Board of Supervisors formally recognized the couple‚Äôs work on behalf of the local INAA chapter with a certificate of honor. That certificate is still posted to the wall behind the bar, though it‚Äôs dwarfed by a large poster depicting the plight of Bobby Sands, the Irish Republican Army member who led the major 1981 hunger strike.To order: Beer ($4)Where: O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs, 598 Fifth Ave., San Francisco; 415-751-1449When: 2:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday and Monday; 1 to 9 p.m. Sunday. Closed Tuesday and Wednesday.In fact, the walls are so crowded with old newspaper clippings, beer advertisements, photos of O‚ÄôKeeffe relatives, maps of Ireland and other paraphernalia that it can be hard to know where to fix your gaze. These are not the collectible curiosities of Specs‚Äô; they‚Äôre Irish aphorisms rendered in bright-green shamrocks, or promotional materials for the IRA. The likenesses of John F. and Robert Kennedy appear throughout.‚ÄúI never take anything down,‚Äù O‚ÄôKeeffe says. Instead, she layers new paraphernalia on top of old ‚Äî a palimpsest that tells the story of her and Tim‚Äôs evolving world, and evolving worldview, over the decades.As I wander around the bar, it seems to me that the walls also constitute a kind of mausoleum, not only commemorating Tim but also the whole story of Ireland in the 20th century, a history marked at every turn by tragedy, struggle and loss.O‚ÄôKeeffe says she will probably retire in a year or two. She hopes to pass the bar along to one of her regular customers. What will she do in retirement? ‚ÄúGo on a cruise,‚Äù she answers, maybe to Mexico or Hawaii.The elder Correia shakes his head knowingly. ‚ÄúWho are you kidding, Annie? You‚Äôll still be here all the time.‚Äù"

146.0,"Nestled in an unassuming building constructed in 1944 as a dry goods storage facility inside the Alameda Naval Air Station, a new business making malted grains has taken root.Locally, Admiral Maltings is the first of its kind ‚Äî not just in Alameda, but in all of California. It is the new project from well-known Bay Area brewers Ron Silberstein (Thirsty Bear) and Dave McLean (Magnolia), with investment from Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman.Their goal: to create a local alternative to the industrial malt used by the Bay Area‚Äôs breweries and distilleries. Admiral Maltings plans to start its first batch of malt toward the end of July, with an attached pub to open in the fall.Already, the team has partnered with family-owned farms in the Sacramento Valley and other parts of California to grow grain that will meet the needs of craft brewers in the Bay Area. As they put it, it will be a malt designed by people in the local beer industry, for people making beer and whiskey professionally.Most beer consists of four core ingredients: grain (usually malted), hops, yeast and water. In recent years, the craft beer world ‚Äî and its consumers ‚Äî have come to understand the importance and intricacies of hops and yeast in special brews, be it an India pale ale with fresh hops or a saison with proprietary yeast strains.Malt has often been overshadowed, because it has been industrialized and obtained through only a few facilities.‚ÄúCurrently, craft brewers do not have local, unique choices (for malt),‚Äù says Silberstein. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs to beer what grapes are to wine.‚ÄùJohn Martin, co-owner of Drake‚Äôs Brewing Company in San Leandro, describes the difference in taste to be akin to how superior the flavor of freshly roasted coffee is to months-old coffee.‚ÄúWorking directly with a small and local raw materials company is very important to us, as well as the opportunity to support and work with small local farmers that will grow the barley we will be using,‚Äù says Martin. ‚ÄúThis will be truly going from ‚Äògrain to glass‚Äô ‚Äî that‚Äôs almost unheard in craft brewing today.‚ÄùThe process of malting involves soaking and germinating the grain. This, in turn, creates enzymes that break down proteins and starches in the brewing process into simple sugars, which the yeast consumes and turns into alcohol and carbon dioxide. It‚Äôs important work ‚Äî no malt, no enzymes, no beer.Industrial malting is typically done in large, stainless-steel tanks that hold hundreds of tons of grain; the walls are several feet thick and it‚Äôs all aerated with an auger and forced air.On the other hand, floor-malting is the traditional way of malting. It is a slower and gentler technique wherein the soaked grain is spread out onto a special floor to a depth of four to six inches thick, and then allowed to sprout, all while it‚Äôs carefully raked and turned by hand. Few places in the country still implement this labor-intensive method, which is said to produce deeper, richer flavor.The scarcity of floor-malting facilities also make it difficult for first-timers to learn the method, says Curtis Davenport, who is heading up the malting operations at Admiral Maltings.A former farmer, he previously experimented malting his organic grain in 2011 in the Santa Barbara area. To learn the craft, he visited all the floor-malting facilities he could, which turned out to be four: Valley Malt in Massachusetts, River Bend in North Carolina, Colorado Maltings in Colorado and Rebel Malt in Nevada.Not too long ago, Silberstein reached out to Davenport about buying his malted barley for his Thirsty Bear brewery, but by chance, that initial call sprouted a plan for them to open a brand-new floor malting facility in Alameda.The potential of a local malt supply is intriguing, because for years, the brewing industry has put a premium on consistency over regional and seasonal variations in flavor. The result is that brewing ingredients are broadly homogenized. Like hops, malt can be more than just some interchangeable ingredient in beer ‚Äî there are differences in flavor that most consumers have never considered.‚ÄúMalt, grown in different places will have different characteristics, and all of that malt is blended together and sold that way so that it‚Äôs really consistent,‚Äù says Jesse Friedman of Almanac Beer Co., which will open a brewery and taproom next door to Admiral Maltings in October.‚ÄúBut sometimes, we don‚Äôt want super consistent; we want unique and interesting, and that sense of terroir. So, for us, to get small-batch malt grown in California is really, really interesting.‚ÄùAdmiral Maltings plans to begin by malting barley, rye, wheat, oats and corn. Down the line, there are considerations of ancient and alternative grain experiments as well.By focusing on developing the flavors and terroir from the grain through the floor-malting and roasting, Admiral Maltings hopes to maintain the unique identity of the grain variety and farm. Not surprisingly, sourcing the grain will be a very large part of the operations, so all the grain they use will be either organic or grown ‚Äúno-till.‚Äù (‚ÄúNo-till‚Äù refers to a technique that minimally disturbs the soil, better trapping carbon from the atmosphere in the soil.)The malt won‚Äôt be for beer only, either. At St. George Spirits, also in Alameda, master distiller Lance Winters plans to create a uniquely Californian malt whiskey. The floor-malting process, coupled with access to a variety of local grains, offers him more choices ‚Äî and the ability to create a spirit with an identifiable sense of place.‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got more variety available out there, you‚Äôve got more ways to express your individual thumbprint,‚Äù says Winters. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really about being able to have a deeper color palette.‚ÄùThe question of how these malts will make their way into the product lines of local breweries remains to be seen. For many brewers, simply swapping out their base grain for Admiral Maltings grain may not work; it won‚Äôt be as simple as substitutions in a recipe.There is also concern about availability; John Martin of Drake‚Äôs is planning on using Admiral Maltings with small, one-off batches to start. Yet Drake‚Äôs uses hundreds of tons of grain a year, so Admiral Maltings will be only be used as a small part of the lineup.‚ÄúFrom an industrial production standpoint, they are going to be a very small malt house, so my expectations are that we will be very limited on the amount of malt that we can get from them,‚Äù says Almanac‚Äôs Friedman. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll probably start doing some really clean experiments that showcase (the malt), so we can do a baseline.‚ÄùKen Grossman of Sierra Nevada is one of the few brewers who has been making a grower-producer beer. Sierra Nevada has farmed its own barley and hops for many years, using its crops to make an organic Estate Ale. For Grossman, Admiral Maltings solves an old problem: having to send the barley out of state to be malted.‚ÄúWhen I started up in 1980, I used to drive my old ‚Äò57 Chevy flatbed down to San Francisco to pick up my own malt each month at the Bauer Schweitzer Malting company, which was located by Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf,‚Äù says Grossman.‚ÄúI sold the truck, but hopefully I will soon be able to make that trek again and pick up a load of malt for a batch of beer.‚Äù Lou Bustamante is a Bay Area writer and author of ‚ÄúThe Complete Cocktail Manual.‚Äù Email: food@sfchronicle.com Twitter: thevillagedrunk The Floor Malting ProcessThe total time for the process, from soaking to finished malt, is about eight days, depending on the type and variety of grain. Grain will arrive to Admiral Maltings in 1-ton tote bags, with site capacity for 300 tons of grain at a time.SteepingThe grain goes into a soaking tank that holds 10 tons of grain and 8,000 gallons of water. Over the course of 36 hours, the tank will be emptied and filled with water three separate times to get the grain very well hydrated. The drained water gets treated on site, passing through a reverse osmosis water filtration system so it can be reused for soaking.GerminationAfter soaking, the barley is spread on one of the two malting floors, about four to six inches deep, spread and turned by hand. Turning the grain is important to aerate, but also keep the rootlets from tangling together into a mat. The germination will generate heat, which needs to be regulated. Poor temperature control, where the process is too warm, results in uneven germination and modification. To control temperature, Admiral Maltings has a radiant cooling system built in to the malting floor.Kilning"

(If you can‚Äôt find roasted belacan, slice the block of belacan thinly, and wrap in a single layer of foil like an envelope, then toast in a dry pan until toasty and crumbly.)Petis udang: A fermented shrimp paste used commonly in Malaysia and Indonesia that has a molasses-like consistency. When Goh can‚Äôt find this ingredient, she buys whatever culture‚Äôs shrimp paste she can find ‚Äî Chinese and Vietnamese are the most common locally ‚Äî then adds a little molasses and soy sauce to achieve the right flavor and color.Galangal: A rhizome often called Thai ginger because it resembles ginger root, but its flavors are sharp citrus and slightly piney. Unlike ginger, galangal is too tough to be grated so it must be peeled and sliced.Tamarind concentrate: A concentrated paste of tamarind that can be found in Asian and Indian grocery stores.The 36-year-old Goh is an adventurous chef, and Instagram has provided her a way to share her experiments, whether she‚Äôs testing spiral curry puff dough or making otak-otak, a seasoned fish cake grilled in banana leaves. She‚Äôs outspoken, too ‚Äî not afraid to call white people out on ‚ÄúColumbusing,‚Äù like when bunga telang, a blue flower used as a natural food dye in Malaysia, became trendy in unicorn drinks because it can change color to pink or purple. She‚Äôs willing to fight for people to use the correct terminology for her food (call her hand-laminated spiral curry puffs ‚Äúempanadas‚Äù at your own peril). ‚ÄúIt bothers me why everything from a foreign culture has to be named something else to be understood,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúStop being lazy, and learn the name.‚ÄùIn the first five minutes of our cooking session, she‚Äôs already flipped everything I know about laksa on its head. The most well-known version, she says, is laksa lemak, also known as curry laksa. It‚Äôs made from coconut cream or milk, cooked with aromatics and served with chicken, shrimp, egg, tofu, vegetables and herbs. It‚Äôs the version you can find everywhere from Australia to Oakland, and the same one that Goh grew up eating at a hawker center in the SS2 neighborhood of Petaling Jaya, just outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia‚Äôs capital. But Goh‚Äôs laksa today has tamarind instead of coconut milk, and is brothless.And then she drops some history in her sermon: Historians believe laksa is the product of intermarriage between Chinese traders and women in port cities of Southeast Asia, mostly Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. The new wives decided to mash up the food their husbands loved (like noodle soups) with the Southeast Asian flavors they loved, like coconut milk and lemongrass. Laksa was born.The dish was a bridge between two cultures, and a super adaptable recipe at that. This is something Goh stresses as she makes her own laksa: There‚Äôs no one way to make it. It‚Äôs a common hawker food, sold by street vendors, and everyone makes it differently. Malaysian cuisine, Goh says, was never codified the way French cuisine was. She thinks this happened because Malaysia was mostly an oral culture before Islam was introduced in the 14th century, which was when it adopted a modified form of Arabic script for the Malay written language. In other words, written records, let alone recipes, didn‚Äôt exist for a large part of Malaysian history.Today, the descendants of Chinese immigrants are known as Peranakans, and Malaysia features three primary regional categories of laksa: laksa lemak (coconut milk-based; popular in Malacca), asam laksa (from the state of Penang, with a sour tamarind broth) and laksa kelantan (from the East Peninsular, gray-white broth from coconut milk and ground fish).But hybrids pop up all the time, and it‚Äôs hard for even Malaysians to keep up. Goh didn‚Äôt know many of them until she moved to Australia for college and became interested in cooking. There, she researched; and then whenever she was home, she started tasting different laksas. In the city of Malacca, there was the laksa kahwin, which translates to marriage laksa; it‚Äôs a product of two  Peranakan communities marrying (Penang and Malacca). ‚ÄúIt has a mix of creamy coconut from laksa lemak and sour notes of asam laksa, although the ratio of the two differs from cook to cook,‚Äù she says.Goh throws her asam laksa kering together in a pan. Kering means dry, so it has more of a chunky, clingy sauce coating the chewy tapioca noodles. Instead of coconut, it has the sour, pungent amalgam of tamarind, mackerel and spicy chile peppers. The garnishes serve as a contrast to the fishy flavor of the noodles: pineapple for sweetness, mint and cucumber for cooling, onion and lime for acidity.A few bites is all it takes to convert me to the laksa gospel.Goh, who immigrated to San Francisco in 2012, actually did get her start on Instagram. She studied marketing and worked in social media, but after posting photos of her food, followers started asking her to host pop-ups. She did her first in 2012 out of her one-bedroom apartment. She now cooks full time for private clients and at her pop-ups (where she often collaborates with other talented immigrant women chefs, like Siska Marcus and Vijitha Shyam; see events on www.eatwithtracy.com).Her goal is to become the voice of Malaysian cuisine in the Bay Area.‚ÄúBy voice, I mean taking the time to educate the public rather than just running Malaysian food establishments for profit. I want to start a laksa fever here,‚Äù she says. She‚Äôs looking to open a restaurant in San Francisco featuring regional Malaysian laksa, to be called Damansara. It‚Äôs named after the suburb of Petaling Jaya where her family lived in for the first 12 years of her life.She ends our meal with a dessert called pulut tekan, glutinous rice steamed in coconut milk and colored naturally with bunga telang (blue pea flower), then pressed into cakes and served with kaya, a coconut milk jam. It‚Äôs decadent, starchy, creamy goodness, and fortifies me perfectly against the drizzle awaiting me outdoors, which, while needed, is still quite dreary.Leena Trivedi-Grenier is a Bay Area freelance writer.

But you come to My Tofu House for the soft tofu soups ‚Äî especially for the kimchi version, made with mushrooms and either pork or beef, adding an aromatic kick of heat to the already-spicy base broth. Crack the raw egg into the soup as soon as it arrives and let it scramble up; the sizzling liquid needs to cool down anyway. Munch in the meantime on the customary banchan ‚Äî mung bean sprouts, cucumbers, tiny whole croaker fish ‚Äî and look forward, once you're done slurping that silky, slippery tofu, to the rice soup that you can spoon out of the tea-filled stone pot on your table.4627 Geary Blvd. (at 10th Avenue); (415) 750-1818.Pork buns at Clement BBQWhat: Barbecue pork buns, both steamed ($2.50 for 3) and baked ($1.50)When: 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily.Dim sum is a competitive market on Clement Street in the Inner Richmond, especially among the many excellent takeout spots (see also: Good Luck, Wing Lee and Gourmet). Each has its specialties, and Clement BBQ's is char siu bao ‚Äî steamed or baked buns, filled with juicy strips of pork dripping in sweet barbecue sauce ‚Äî which, for those who keep track of such things, have much more satisfying bao-meat ratios than the versions at many neighborhood rivals. One or two bao can be lunch, but you might as well get a pink doughnut box's worth, and throw in a light, challah-like taro bun for dessert. Forget the pricey brunch at Hong Kong Lounge II; you couldn't spend $20 here if you tried.617 Clement St. (at Seventh Avenue); (415) 752-9520. Turkey¬†sandwich at Arguello¬†What: Hot roasted turkey sandwich ($7.99), add cheddar ($1)When: 7:30 a.m.-8 p.m. daily.Arguello‚Äôs turkey sandwich is famous for a reason. The beloved neighborhood grocery didn‚Äôt invent putting turkey between slices of bread, but it may have perfected it. The thick-carved poultry ‚Äî white and dark meat ‚Äî gives so much more than your typical thin-shaved deli rendition. They‚Äôll ask what kind of bread you want, but it‚Äôs a trick ‚Äî you have to get Dutch crunch. Loaded with crunchy lettuce, smears of mayo and mustard, sharp red onion, tomato and (crucially) pickle slices, it‚Äôs complete on its own, but made better with a slice of cheddar cheese.782 Arguello Blvd. (at Cabrillo); (415) 751-5121. Russian breakfast at Cinderella BakeryWhat: Pelmeni ($10) or potato varenki ($8) or blenchiki with sweet cheese ($6)When: 7 a.m.-7 p.m. daily.The Richmond is a dumpling paradise, and that doesn‚Äôt only apply to bao and har gow: Cinderella Bakery‚Äôs pelmeni, tender little dough spheres filled with succulent pork, will satisfy the most dire Sunday-morning dim sum craving. Or opt for the potato vareniki, pierogi-like, or the blenchiki ‚Äî a rolled-up crepe, which can be filled with sweet cheese and dipped in jam, or with mushrooms or meat. All respond well when smeared with sour cream. The possibilities at Cinderella, which draws a sizable line on weekends, are nearly endless: the irresistible fried piroshki pocket with beef; the decadent, flaky, cream-filled strawberry turnover. Pity the unadventurous patron in line ahead of you who‚Äôs ordering the turkey and avocado sandwich. (For that, go to Arguello.)436 Balboa St. (at Sixth Avenue); (415) 751-9690.  Sichuan¬†chicken at Chili House What: Chicken with explosive chili pepper ($13.95)When: Wed.-Mon. 11 a.m.-10 p.m., until 11 p.m. Fri-SatYou could ball out at Chili House, where chef Tong Gang Wang offers 16-course Beijing banquets verging on fine art. But there‚Äôs another way to do Chili House: stopping in for a casual weeknight meal of old-school, satisfying Sichuan food. (I can‚Äôt promise you won‚Äôt salivate while watching Peking duck carved table side for the more indulgent guests at the table next to yours, but save that for a special occasion.) A heaping pile of chicken nuggets, drowned in shiny red slivers of chiles and scallions, looks more mouth-numbing than it is: The oily little chiles add more flavor than heat, and the crisp cubes of meat rival any fried chicken dish in town.726 Clement St. (at Eighth Avenue); (415) 387-2658. Soup dumplings at Xiao Long BaoWhat: Xiao long bao ($4.50 for 6)When: 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily.Granted, soup dumplings don't seem like the most takeout-friendly fare. Half the fun of ordering them in a restaurant is opening the bamboo steamer at your table, releasing their aromas into the room, carefully seizing them with tongs and placing them on your ceramic spoon. But the xiao long bao at Xiao Long Bao are so good, you won't care that the pork- and broth-filled dumplings come in individual aluminum cups inside a plastic takeout container. (Yes, the black vinegar is included.) Just make sure to eat them while they're warm. The bao are sold in orders of six, which is a good start, but think of it like ordering oysters: If you're being honest with yourself, you want a dozen.625 Clement St. (at Seventh Avenue); (415) 666-3998.Noodles at Mandalay What: Mandalay special noodle ($14)When: 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. and 5-9:30 p.m. Mon. and Wed.-Thurs.; and until 10 p.m. Fri.; open continuously 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m. Sat.-Sun.If only those patient hordes of San Franciscans who wait in line for hours at Burma Superstar knew that a short walk to California Street would bring them to Mandalay, where the lines are invariably shorter, the Burmese fare just as soulful and the decor ‚Äî fountains, pendant ornaments, lots of gold ‚Äî much more entertaining. The tea leaf salad, tasty as it is, doesn‚Äôt constitute a full meal, but the Mandalay special noodle offers the same thrill of table-side preparation. The dish‚Äôs broad rice noodles swim in a shallow pool of light, tangy curry broth with tender chicken and crunchy fried noodles on top. It‚Äôs cilantro, it‚Äôs coconut, it‚Äôs lime. It‚Äôs a little funky, in a good way. You may think you can share it, but you won‚Äôt want to.4348 California St. (at Sixth Avenue); (415) 386-3895. Banh mi at Caf√© Bunn Mi¬† What: Pork belly sandwich ($7.50)When: 9 a.m.-9 p.m. daily.The classic combination pork banh mi is a fine choice at this laid-back Vietnamese cafe, with its rich head cheese terrine, liver pate and pork loaf (that‚Äôs ‚Äúfancy pork‚Äù to you). The colorful pork belly sandwich, however, is what Bunn Mi does best: crisp and fatty, smeared with aioli and vinaigrette, with cole slaw, cilantro and hard-boiled egg heaped inside crunchy French bread. Bunn Mi is hardly the only banh mi shop on this stretch of Clement Street, and may not be able to match the $4 sandwich prices of nearby Eternal Springs. But trust me: It‚Äôs the best.417 Clement St. (at Sixth Avenue); (415) 668-8908.  Ramen at Kaiju Eats What: Karaage ramen ($13)When: Daily lunch (11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Mon.-Fri. and noon-3 p.m. Sat.-Sun.) and dinner (5-10 p.m.).Ramen purists may balk at Kaiju‚Äôs over-the-top fried chicken creation, with its garlic soy broth, cubes of karaage and drizzles of curry aioli. Fine. Try it and get back to us. The chicken is perfect, its crisp exterior yielding to moist dark meat, and the soup includes not a half, but a whole egg. (Isn‚Äôt that the best part of ramen?) A warning, though: It‚Äôs garlicky enough that first dates might want to steer clear. Bold flavors like these are what Kaiju does best, whether it‚Äôs their messy sweet potato satsuma fries, the K.O. tonkatsu (a meat lovers‚Äô paradise with baby back ribs, meatballs and chashu) or the ponzu-loaded tuna tataki sizzling on a bed of soccorat-crusted rice. This is not food for the flavor-averse.3409 Geary Blvd. (at Beaumont); (415) 742-4309. Breakfast sandwich at The Richfield What: Brekkie sandwich ($7) plus matcha latte ($4.75)When: 7:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Tue.-Fri. and 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Sat.-Sun.More likely than not, you‚Äôll miss the Richfield, which nestles into the island where California and Cornwall streets form a triangle with Fifth Avenue. But the diminutive coffee shop, which draws a yoga-pants-and-tiny-dogs crowd, is good for more than just an overpriced slab of avocado toast: It‚Äôs also got a disarmingly tasty breakfast sandwich that somehow manages to satisfy a greasy-bodega craving. Two slices of sweet King‚Äôs Hawaiian toast frame a fluffy omelet, crunchy bacon and a generous helping of melted orange cheddar cheese, with a sweet ‚Äúhouse special sauce‚Äù that will make you forget you ever wanted Sriracha on your eggs. Add a matcha latte ‚Äî unsweetened ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre not wearing yoga pants."
156.0,"Life is frustratingly resistant to order, which is why we find comfort in generalizations. People need to make sense of things by taking what we‚Äôve experienced and extrapolating some tidiness from it.Now this is more of a statement than a generalization, but it‚Äôs based on my not-negligible experience: El Molino Central in Boyes Hot Springs serves the best Mexican food in the Bay Area.A molino is a place where nixtamalized corn ‚Äî that is, dried corn that‚Äôs been simmered in an alkaline bath, washed and hulled ‚Äî is ground into masa, the life-giving dough that‚Äôs used to make tortillas, tamales, gorditas, sopes, panuchos and other maize-based wonders. Nixtamalization predates Columbus and has been employed for centuries to unlock nutrients in corn that our bodies can‚Äôt reach on their own. It‚Äôs a tricky process to get right, and there are relatively few places that actually bother to do it from scratch. More often than you‚Äôd hope, ‚Äúfresh tortillas‚Äù are made with Maseca: powdered, instant masa.Thankfully, the name El Molino Central is not just decorative. Stone-ground, organic masa is at the heart of the food here.If you‚Äôve browsed the tortilla section at nearly any San Francisco grocery store, you might already be familiar with the corn-grinding work of El Molino‚Äôs owner, Karen Taylor. Her company, Primavera, has been selling ready-made tamales, tortillas, chips and salsas around the Bay Area for more than 25 years. And on Saturday mornings at the Ferry Building, her stand offers hefty plates of chilaquiles ‚Äî thick chips cooked until crunchy-tender in red or green salsa, with soft scrambled eggs and refried beans ‚Äî that have pulled me and many others back from the brink of hangover-induced ruin on numerous occasions.Taylor opened El Molino Central seven years ago as a place where she could serve a wider range of freshly prepared food, along with a decent cup of coffee. I first chanced upon the restaurant while passing through the area, desperate for a caffeine bump. Back then, the coffee was Blue Bottle. Nowadays, they‚Äôre using beans from Jewel Box in Oakland. Taylor says she likes them because they‚Äôre not overly fussy about how their coffee should be brewed. El Molino Central is not fussy.You order your food from a register in the front. There‚Äôs a refrigerator behind you where you can pick out beer and wine by the bottle. And there are often a few paper-wrapped to-go stacks of warm tortillas on the counter, which I always find hard to pass up, if only so I can breathe in their aroma while waiting for my food. You walk into the kitchen, then through a swinging screen door to get to the dining room, which comprises a covered patio and a gravel lot furnished with picnic tables, gas heaters and a relatively new pergola.The cooking at El Molino veers toward slowly cooked meats, stews and sauces paired with various manifestations of fresh masa. Taylor is a disciple of Diana Kennedy, the famed cookbook author and prevailing English-language authority on Mexican cuisine. She‚Äôs known Kennedy for years and shares her fascination with ‚Äî and rigorous approach to ‚Äî understanding the regional cooking of Mexico.There are always two or three tacos on the menu, but not the sort one polishes off while hunched over beside a street-side stall. The tacos here feel somehow gentler and more deliberate than those of a taqueria, like the difference between barbecuing and grilling. In fact, my favorite of El Molino‚Äôs taco fillings is the barbacoa: shreds of lamb pulled from a whole animal cooked at a leisurely pace over maguey leaves and under charcoal in a Caja China roasting box.El Molino‚Äôs tortillas are large and thick, bouncy and bewitchingly fragrant. They‚Äôre moister and more tender than your typical corn tortilla, without being mushy or too soft. Sopes ‚Äî hand-formed masa cups shaped like shallow ashtrays ‚Äî are made from the same dough but have a griddled crispness that persists even when buried under shredded chicken and doused in thin salsa. Chips and tostadas are made from different batches of masa where the corn has been washed more thoroughly, producing a satisfying, shattery crunch. Of all the masa preparations at El Molino Central, the tamales move me least. I tend to find that the delicacy of fresh masa is lost when you wrap a brick of it in a banana leaf and steam it. I recognize that this is probably an unpopular opinion, and I‚Äôm OK with that. Maybe I‚Äôm just not a tamale guy.But hey, we can all agree on the beans, right? Everybody flips out about El Molino Central‚Äôs beans. Sometimes they‚Äôre pinto, sometimes they‚Äôre black, but they‚Äôre always refried in freshly rendered lard with onion and either fresh or dried chiles or chile adobo. Be advised: If you choose to order family style, the beans will disappear first.¬†Taylor will be the first to tell you that both El Molino Central and Primavera are wholly dependent on her crew: mostly women, all Latino immigrants. Almost all of them hail from different states of Mexico ‚Äî Guerrero, Oaxaca, Jalisco, Michoac√°n ‚Äî and several have been working for the company for decades. People will often comment to Taylor about the loyalty she inspires in her employees, pointing to the times she‚Äôs helped them with medical bills and paid leave, watched their dogs, granted time off, attended quincea√±eras and christenings, and raised money for organizations that offer support to the local Latino community. But Taylor is quick to insist that that‚Äôs not the whole story.‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm a fair employer,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut at the same time, I‚Äôm benefiting from my employees. I benefit from the fact that a lot of them learned to cook from their mothers.‚ÄùThe mole on the menu at El Molino is listed as Zoraida‚Äôs mole, but it‚Äôs actually Zoraida Juarez‚Äôs mother‚Äôs recipe. It‚Äôs everything you want in a mole: complex earthiness, faint sweetness, an evasive color that ‚Äúbrown‚Äù or ‚Äúburnt umber‚Äù don‚Äôt do justice to. But Zoraida‚Äôs sister Alfonsina Juarez says it‚Äôs not quite the way mom used to make it. In the coastal part of Oaxaca, where they grew up, their mother would cook the mole over an open fire, giving the sauce a whisper of smokiness. And the breadcrumbs they sometimes used to thicken the mole came from bread they baked themselves.Taylor says that recipe development at El Molino usually unfolds in three stages. First, she comes up with something she wants to try, usually drawn from a memory of eating in Mexico. She‚Äôll ask around to see if anyone on staff has experience making what she has in mind, then do some research on her own. Then they‚Äôll start experimenting. Most of the time, the women aren‚Äôt cooking food they grew up with. (When I ask them, their favorite dishes tend to be ones that don‚Äôt come from where they do.) Taylor values their regional expertise, but she also pushes them to join her in learning about food from other parts of the country.Liliana Calvario and Maurilia Pineda have both been working for Taylor for more than 20 years. I ask them how much thought they‚Äôve given to Taylor, a white woman from California, cooking Mexican food. Calvario says it crossed her mind in the beginning, and that it still comes up from time to time, but the conclusion is always that Taylor is the real deal. They‚Äôve learned a lot from her, she says. Pineda agrees. She and Taylor have worked side by side on recipes, and she knows that Taylor is not like other gabachas dabbling in the Mexican hustle.Still, Alfonsina Juarez points out that the people in her neighborhood in Boyes Hot Springs don‚Äôt eat at El Molino. They have simpler tastes, she says, but their bosses come here. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt think the food‚Äôs legit ‚Äî they‚Äôll often ask if Taylor is Mexican ‚Äî but they imagine it‚Äôs too expensive. Many of her friends and family are employed in the filas ‚Äî ‚Äúthe rows,‚Äù i.e. the vineyards.¬†The population of Boyes Hot Springs is mostly Latino and the economy is largely dependent on tourism and grape-growing ‚Äî difficult, inconsistent industries. It‚Äôs a small, quiet area 10 minutes from Sonoma Square that‚Äôs recently seen a number of infrastructure improvements: new sidewalks and streetlamps, and a plan for a town plaza. But Taylor‚Äôs been robbed three times in the past year. Twice, someone broke into her car while she ducked into Primavera, stealing the bag of cash from the farmers‚Äô market. The third time, burglars ransacked her house in search of money they knew she was pooling for various construction projects and a new restaurant‚Äôs liquor license.I won‚Äôt get too deep into the details of the whodunit. Suffice it to say that investigators haven‚Äôt been looking more than a couple degrees beyond Taylor‚Äôs current or former employees to find suspects. The perpetrators knew where she kept her money, and how to get to it.I ask Taylor if this makes her feel betrayed. I wonder if she sees the robberies as a rebuke from the community she‚Äôs been working with for 30 years.She says she was naive, but not about the community. She shouldn‚Äôt have left anything in the car, or told anyone she had money at her house. She should have installed security cameras and motion sensors earlier. But people get robbed everywhere. She looks at the responsible parties as individuals. It‚Äôs not a community that victimized her ‚Äî it was probably some punk kids.We make generalizations because that‚Äôs the best way we can manage the flood of information besieging us these days. We hear about ‚Äúbad hombres‚Äù and we either accept it as truth or reject it with our own generalization: ‚ÄúImmigrants are good, hard-working people.‚Äù Either way, I think it‚Äôs too simplistic.The only way to make any satisfying sense of the world is to engage with its disorderliness. I don‚Äôt think El Molino Central is a paragon of perfect racial integration. Nor do I think Taylor should be seen as exceptional for her generosity. She is, however, commendable for showing up. Doing so is never simple, but delicious things can come from trying. Chris Ying is a writer, editor and co-founder of Lucky Peach. Email: food@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @chrisyingz ¬†"
159.0,"To develop a cooking repertoire you have to be a bit of a thief. I wasn‚Äôt born knowing any of the tried-and-true recipes that I make most nights of the week. Someone had to teach me how to make chocolate chip cookies; others had roasted a crisp-skinned chicken before I came along.There may be a few original recipes out there, but for the most part what we cook is learned (or stolen) from someone else. How many times have you asked a friend for a beloved recipe they first made for you? Hell, even Bon Appetit magazine once had a column, RSVP, where readers requested favorite recipes they‚Äôd first tried at restaurants.I draw inspiration and steal recipes from other cooks all the time. In my own kitchen I‚Äôll replicate the dish, making it a few times (as I‚Äôve said before: Repetition is the key to really understanding a recipe and, in turn, making it your own), or I‚Äôll play around with the same combination of flavors and create a different recipe, inspired by the original. But sometimes I find that the original recipe requires no tinkering at all.Even if you own ‚ÄúA16 Food+Wine,‚Äù you might have overlooked the roasted asparagus with walnut crema. It‚Äôs a recipe from the cookbook, published 10 years ago, and it‚Äôd be easy to skip right past it, especially because the book also has recipes for ricotta gnocchi and chocolate gelato and all the other signatures that make that restaurant so great. I tend to have a short attention span when it comes to cookbooks, often making only one or two recipes from a book before moving on to the next, so I got supremely lucky that this asparagus recipe was one of the first I tried.It has a few things going for it: It‚Äôs dead simple, and it‚Äôs really quick to make, but it seems so elegant, and it tastes so good. Simple and quick are the words buzzing in my head as I race from school pickup to home kitchen, a grocery stop often thrown in between. Simple and quick is on my mind as I help my kid with homework, answer a few lingering emails, drag the garbage cans to the curb, working on dinner throughout.For this recipe you blanch walnuts in salted water until tender, then whiz them in the food processor with some sauteed onion and olive oil. That‚Äôs it. Your nominal effort is rewarded by a rich, complex spread, hummuslike in texture but with a nutty sweetness. Spooned onto a platter, it becomes a foundation for roasted (or blanched) asparagus; topped with some fried eggs and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano it becomes dinner, simple and quick.
