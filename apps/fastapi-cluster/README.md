# About

This small project will highlight how we can take our work and package it into APIs with [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).  I want to highlight that with a few lines of code, we can extend our work and get closer to production-quality applications.  

## Benefits and Use Cases

- data product prototyping 
- operationalize machine learning inference
- provide a simple interface to kick off analytics jobs and pipelines

There are other ways that we can build above beyond FastAPI (e.g. Google Cloud Vertex AI API), but I have seen this framework really starting to appear in practice and I wanted to provide a brief example in hopes it helps you frame what is possible.

## Resources

Run with `uvicorn main:app --reload` within this directory, as it will look for `main.py` in the working directory and mapp this to the app.  The `--reload` is nice for active development.

> The fastAPI site has some great documentation to explore!
