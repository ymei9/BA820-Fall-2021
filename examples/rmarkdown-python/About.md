# About

-   Using "R"Markdown, this builds a self-contained HTML report that is styled via the `rmdformats` package (in R).

-   Other output formats exist, namely PDFs. You can get a whole host of themes via `rticles` library ( in R).

The formats to consider:

-   `xaringan` for amazing slide decks. There is example here on github.

-   `rmdformats` to help style HTML reports

-   `rticles` for article-like formatting. I like the `arxiv` format.

-   `flexdashboard` to build stand-alone dashboards. I have personally used this for a few client projects.
