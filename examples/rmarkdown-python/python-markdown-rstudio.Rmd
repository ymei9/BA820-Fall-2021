## This is an Introduction

This is some text.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Basic Setup

Let's build out a simple dataset

```{python}
a = np.random.randint(0, 11, size=(12, 2))
adf = pd.DataFrame(a, columns=['x', 'y'])
```

Let's look at the first few rows:

```{python}
adf.head(3)
```

## Plotting

And now lets plot it up:

```{python, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# results = 'hide' still plots, but prevents the matplotlib text from printing
sns.scatterplot(data=adf, x="x", y="y")
plt.show()
```

We can think about this work here.^[This is a footnote]

The above plot was created with the command:

```{python echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sns.scatterplot(data=adf, x="x", y="y")
plt.show()
```
